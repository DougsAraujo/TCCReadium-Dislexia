<div class="text">
<p>Perhaps I should admit on the title page that this book is "By
L. Frank Baum and his correspondents," for I have used many
suggestions conveyed to me in letters from children. Once on a time
I really imagined myself "an author of fairy tales," but now I am
merely an editor or private secretary for a host of youngsters
whose ideas I am requestsed to weave into the thread of my
stories.</p>
<p>These ideas are often clever. They are also logical and
interesting. So I have used them whenever I could find an
opportunity, and it is but just that I acknowledge my indebtedness
to my little friends.</p>
<p>My, what imaginations these children have developed! Sometimes I
am fairly astounded by their daring and genius. There will be no
lack of fairy-tale authors in the future, I am sure. My readers
have told me what to do with Dorothy, and Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,
and I have obeyed their mandates. They have also given me a variety
of subjects to write about in the future: enough, in fact, to keep
me busy for some time. I am very proud of this alliance. Children
love these stories because children have helped to create them. My
readers know what they want and realize that I try to please them.
The result is very satisfactory to the publishers, to me, and (I am
quite sure) to the children.</p>
<p>I hope, my dears, it will be a long time before we are obliged
to dissolve partnership.</p>
<p>L. FRANK BAUM.</p>
