How the Story of Oz Came to an End</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>The writer of these Oz stories has received a little note from
Princess Dorothy of Oz which, for a time, has made him feel rather
disconcerted. The note was written on a broad, white feather from a
stork's wing, and it said:</p>
<p>"YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ANYTHING MORE ABOUT OZ, BECAUSE WE ARE NOW
CUT OFF FOREVER FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT TOTO AND I WILL
ALWAYS LOVE YOU AND ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO LOVE US.</p>
<p>"DOROTHY GALE."</p>
<p>This seemed to me too bad, at first, for Oz is a very
interesting fairyland. Still, we have no right to feel grieved, for
we have had enough of the history of the Land of Oz to fill six
story books, and from its quaint people and their strange
adventures we have been able to learn many useful and amusing
things.</p>
<p>So good luck to little Dorothy and her companions. May they live
long in their invisible country and be very happy!</p>
<p>THE END</p>
