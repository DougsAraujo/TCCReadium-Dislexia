source code.  This is true regardless of whether the software normally
runs in source form (i.e., can be interpreted, like Perl, Python, PHP,
etc.) or needs to be compiled first (like C, C++, Java, etc.).  With
compiled software, most users will probably not compile the sources
themselves, but will instead install from pre-built binary packages
(see <a class="xref" href="ch07s04.html#binary-packages" title="Binary Packages">the section called “Binary Packages”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>).  However, those binary
packages are still derived from a master source distribution.  The
point of the source package is to unambiguously define the release.
When the project distributes "Scanley 2.5.0", what it means,
specifically, is "The tree of source code files that, when compiled
(if necessary) and installed, produces Scanley 2.5.0."</p><p>There is a fairly strict standard for how source releases
should look.  One will occasionally see deviations from this standard,
but they are the exception, not the rule.  Unless there is a compelling
reason to do otherwise, your project should follow this standard
too.</p><div class="sect2" title="Format"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="packaging-format"/>Format</h2></div></div></div><p>The source code should be shipped in the standard formats for
transporting directory trees.  For Unix and Unix-like operating
systems, the convention is to use TAR format, compressed
by <span class="command"><strong>compress</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>gzip</strong></span>,
<span class="command"><strong>bzip</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>bzip2</strong></span>.  For MS Windows,
the standard method for distributing directory trees
is <em class="firstterm">zip</em> format, which happens to do compression
as well, so there is no need to compress the archive after creating
it.</p><div class="sidebar" title="TAR Files"><a id="packaging-tar"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>TAR Files</strong></p></div></div></div><p><em class="firstterm">TAR</em> stands for "Tape ARchive",
   because tar format represents a directory tree as a linear data
   stream, which makes it ideal for saving directory trees to tape.
   The same property also makes it the standard for distributing
   directory trees as a single file.  Producing compressed tar files
   (or <em class="firstterm">tarballs</em>) is pretty easy.  On some
   systems, the <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> command can produce a
   compressed archive itself; on others, a separate compression
   program is used.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Name and Layout"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="packaging-name-and-layout"/>Name and Layout</h2></div></div></div><p>The name of the package should consist of the software's name
plus the release number, plus the format suffixes appropriate for the
archive type.  For example, Scanley 2.5.0, packaged for Unix using GNU
Zip (gzip) compression, would look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</p></div></div><p>or for Windows using zip compression:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.zip</p></div></div><p>Either of these archives, when unpacked, should create a single
new directory tree named <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code> in the
current directory.  Underneath the new directory, the source code
should be arranged in a layout ready for compilation (if compilation
is needed) and installation.  In the top level of new directory tree,
there should be a plain text <code class="filename">README</code> file
explaining what the software does and what release this is, and giving
pointers to other resources, such as the project's web site, other
files of interest, etc.  Among those other files should be an
<code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file, sibling to
the <code class="filename">README</code> file, giving instructions on how to build
and install the software for all the operating systems it supports.
As mentioned in
<a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#license-quickstart-applying" title="How to Apply a License to Your Software">the section called “How to Apply a License to Your Software”</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started</em></a></span>, there should also
be a <code class="filename">COPYING</code> or <code class="filename">LICENSE</code>
file, giving the software's terms of distribution.</p><p>There should also be a <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file
(sometimes called <code class="filename">NEWS</code>), explaining what's new in
this release.  The <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file accumulates
changelists for all releases, in reverse chronological order, so that
the list for this release appears at the top of the file.  Completing
that list is usually the last thing done on a stabilizing release
branch; some projects write the list piecemeal as they're developing,
others prefer to save it all up for the end and have one person write
it, getting information by combing the version control logs.  The list
looks something like this:</p><pre class="screen">
Version 2.5.0
(20 December 2004, from /branches/2.5.x)
http://svn.scanley.org/repos/svn/tags/2.5.0/

 New features, enhancements:
    * Added regular expression queries (issue #53)
    * Added support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 documents
    * Documentation translated into Polish, Russian, Malagasy
    * ...

 Bugfixes:
    * fixed reindexing bug (issue #945)
    * fixed some query bugs (issues #815, #1007, #1008)
    * ...
</pre><p>The list can be as long as necessary, but don't bother to
include every little bugfix and feature enhancement.  Its purpose is
simply to give users an overview of what they would gain by upgrading
to the new release.  In fact, the changelist is customarily included
in the announcement email (see
<a class="xref" href="ch07s05.html" title="Testing and Releasing">the section called “Testing and Releasing”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so write it with that
audience in mind.</p><div class="sidebar" title="CHANGES Versus ChangeLog"><a id="changelog"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>CHANGES Versus ChangeLog</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Traditionally, a file named <em class="firstterm">ChangeLog</em>
   lists every change ever made to a project—that is, every
   revision committed to the version control system.  There are
   various formats for ChangeLog files; the details of the formats
   aren't important here, as they all contain the same information:
   the date of the change, its author, and a brief summary (or just
   the log message for that change).</p><p>A <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file is different.  It too is
   a list of changes, but only the ones thought important for a
   certain audience to see, and often with metadata like the exact
   date and author stripped off.  To avoid confusion, don't use the
   terms interchangeably.  Some projects use "NEWS" instead of
   "CHANGES"; although this avoids the potential for confusion with
   "ChangeLog", it is a bit of a misnomer, since the CHANGES file
   retains change information for all releases, and thus has a lot of
   old news in addition to the new news at the top.</p><p>ChangeLog files may be slowly disappearing anyway.  They were
   helpful in the days when CVS was the only choice of version control
   system, because change data was not easy to extract from CVS.
   However, with more recent version control systems, the data that
   used to be kept in the ChangeLog can be requested from the version
   control repository at any time, making it pointless for the project
   to keep a static file containing that data—in fact, worse
   than pointless, since the ChangeLog would merely duplicate the log
   messages already stored in the repository.</p></div><p>The actual layout of the source code inside the tree should be
the same as, or as similar as possible to, the source code layout one
would get by checking out the project directly from its version
control repository.  Usually there are a few differences, for example
because the package contains some generated files needed for
configuration and compilation (see
<a class="xref" href="ch07s04.html#packaging-build-install" title="Compilation and Installation">the section called “Compilation and Installation”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), or because it includes
third-party software that is not maintained by the project, but that
is required and that users are not likely to already have.  But even
if the distributed tree corresponds exactly to some development tree
in the version control repository, the distribution itself should not
be a working copy (see <a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#vc-vocabulary-working-copy"><em class="firstterm">working copy</em></a>).
The release is supposed to represent a static reference point—a
particular, unchangeable configuration of source files.  If it were a
working copy, the danger would be that the user might update it, and
afterward think that he still has the release when in fact he has
something different.</p><p>Remember that the package is the same regardless of the
packaging.  The release—that is, the precise entity referred to
when someone says "Scanley 2.5.0"—is the tree created by
unpacking a zip file or tarball.  So the project might offer all of
these for download:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.tar.bz2<br/>
scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz<br/>
scanley-2.5.0.zip</p></div></div><p>...but the source tree created by unpacking them must be the
same.  That source tree is the distribution; the form in which it is
downloaded is merely a matter of convenience.  Certain trivial
differences between source packages are allowable: for example, in the
Windows package, text files should have lines ending with CRLF
(Carriage Return and Line Feed), while Unix packages should use just
LF.  The trees may be arranged slightly differently between source
packages destined for different operating systems, too, if those
operating systems require different sorts of layouts for compilation.
However, these are all basically trivial transformations.  The basic
source files should be the same across all the packagings of a given
release.</p><div class="sect3" title="To capitalize or not to capitalize"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="release-capitalization"/>To capitalize or not to capitalize</h3></div></div></div><p>When referring to a project by name, people generally capitalize
it as a proper noun, and capitalize acronyms if there are any:
"MySQL 5.0", "Scanley 2.5.0", etc.  Whether this
capitalization is reproduced in the package name is up to the project.
Either <code class="filename">Scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> or
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> would be fine, for example
(I personally prefer the latter, because I don't like to make people
hit the shift key, but plenty of projects ship capitalized packages).
The important thing is that the directory created by unpacking the
tarball use the same capitalization.  There should be no surprises:
the user must be able to predict with perfect accuracy the name of the
directory that will be created when she unpacks a distribution.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Pre-releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="release-prereleases"/>Pre-releases</h3></div></div></div><p>When shipping a pre-release or candidate release, the qualifier
is truly a part of the release number, so include it in the name of
the package's name.  For example, the ordered sequence of alpha and
beta releases given earlier in
<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#release-number-components" title="Release Number Components">the section called “Release Number Components”</a> would result in
package names like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.3.0-alpha1.tar.gz<br/>
scanley-2.3.0-alpha2.tar.gz<br/>
scanley-2.3.0-beta1.tar.gz<br/>
scanley-2.3.0-beta2.tar.gz<br/>
scanley-2.3.0-beta3.tar.gz<br/>
scanley-2.3.0.tar.gz</p></div></div><p>The first would unpack into a directory
named <code class="filename">scanley-2.3.0-alpha1</code>, the second into
<code class="filename">scanley-2.3.0-alpha2</code>, and so on.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Compilation and Installation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="packaging-build-install"/>Compilation and Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>For software requiring compilation or installation from source,
there are usually standard procedures that experienced users expect to
be able to follow.  For example, for programs written in C, C++, or
certain other compiled languages, the standard under Unix-like systems
is for the user to type:</p><pre class="screen">
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install
</pre><p>The first command autodetects as much about the environment as
it can and prepares for the build process, the second command builds
the software in place (but does not install it), and the last command
installs it on the system.  The first two commands are done as a
regular user, the third as root.  For more details about setting up
this system, see the excellent <em class="citetitle">GNU Autoconf, Automake, and
Libtool</em> book by Vaughan, Elliston, Tromey, and Taylor.  It
is published as treeware by New Riders, and its content is also freely
available online at
<a class="ulink" href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/">http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/</a>.</p><p>This is not the only standard, though it is one of the most
widespread.  The Ant (<a class="ulink" href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>) build
system is gaining popularity, especially with projects written in
Java, and it has its own standard procedures for building and
installing.  Also, certain programming languages, such as Perl and
Python, recommend that the same method be used for most programs
written in that language (for example, Perl modules use the
command <span class="command"><strong>perl Makefile.PL</strong></span>).  If it's not
obvious to you what the applicable standards are for your project, ask
an experienced developer; you can safely assume
that <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> standard applies, even if you don't
know what it is at first.</p><p>Whatever the appropriate standards for you project are, don't
deviate from them unless you absolutely must.  Standard installation
procedures are practically spinal reflexes for a lot of system
administrators now.  If they see familiar invocations documented in
your project's <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file, that instantly
raises their faith that your project is generally aware of
conventions, and that it is likely to have gotten other things right
as well.  Also, as discussed in
<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#downloads" title="Downloads">the section called “Downloads”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started</em></a></span>, having a standard
build procedure pleases potential developers.</p><p>On Windows, the standards for building and installing are a bit
less settled.  For projects requiring compilation, the general
convention seems to be to ship a tree that can fit into the
workspace/project model of the standard Microsoft development
environments (Developer Studio, Visual Studio, VS.NET, MSVC++, etc.).
Depending on the nature of your software, it may be possible to offer
a Unix-like build option on Windows via the Cygwin
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>) environment.  And of course,
if you're using a language or programming framework that comes with
its own build and install conventions—e.g., Perl or
Python—you should simply use whatever the standard method is for
that framework, whether on Windows, Unix, Mac OS X, or any other
operating system.</p><p>Be willing to put in a lot of extra effort in order to make your
project conform to the relevant build or installation standards.
Building and installing is an entry point: it's okay for things to get
harder after that, if they absolutely must, but it would be a shame
for the user's or developer's very first interaction with the software
to require unexpected steps.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Binary Packages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="binary-packages"/>Binary Packages</h2></div></div></div><p>Although the formal release is a source code package, most users
will install from binary packages, either provided by their operating
system's software distribution mechanism, or obtained manually from
the project web site or from some third party.  Here "binary" doesn't
necessarily mean "compiled"; it just means any pre-configured form of
the package that allows a user to install it on his computer without
going through the usual source-based build and install procedures.  On
RedHat GNU/Linux, it is the RPM system; on Debian GNU/Linux, it is the
APT (<code class="filename">.deb</code>) system; on MS Windows, it's usually
<code class="literal">.MSI</code> files or self-installing
<code class="literal">.exe</code> files.</p><p>Whether these binary packages are assembled by people closely
associated with the project, or by distant third parties, users are
going to <span class="emphasis"><em>treat</em></span> them as equivalent to the
project's official releases, and will file issues in the project's bug
tracker based on the behavior of the binary packages.  Therefore, it
is in the project's interest to provide packagers with clear
guidelines, and work closely with them to see to it that what they
produce represents the software fairly and accurately.</p><p>The main thing packagers need to know is that they should always
base their binary packages on an official source release.  Sometimes
packagers are tempted to pull a later incarnation of the code from the
repository, or include selected changes that were committed after the
release was made, in order to provide users with certain bug fixes or
other improvements.  The packager thinks he is doing his users a favor
by giving them the more recent code, but actually this practice can
cause a great deal of confusion.  Projects are prepared to receive
reports of bugs found in released versions, and bugs found in recent
trunk and major branch code (that is, found by people who deliberately
run bleeding edge code).  When a bug report comes in from these
sources, the responder will often be able to confirm that the bug is
known to be present in that snapshot, and perhaps that it has since
been fixed and that the user should upgrade or wait for the
next release.  If it is a previously unknown bug, having the precise
release makes it easier to reproduce and easier to categorize in the
tracker.</p><p>Projects are not prepared, however, to receive bug reports based
on unspecified intermediate or hybrid versions.  Such bugs can be hard
to reproduce; also, they may be due to unexpected interactions in
isolated changes pulled in from later development, and thereby cause
misbehaviors that the project's developers should not have to take the
blame for.  I have even seen dismayingly large amounts of time wasted
because a bug was <span class="emphasis"><em>absent</em></span> when it should have been
present: someone was running a slightly patched up version, based on
(but not identical to) an official release, and when the predicted bug
did not happen, everyone had to dig around a lot to figure out
why.</p><p>Still, there will sometimes be circumstances when a packager
insists that modifications to the source release are necessary.
Packagers should be encouraged to bring this up with the project's
developers and describe their plans.  They may get approval, but
failing that, they will at least have notified the project of their
intentions, so the project can watch out for unusual bug reports.  The
developers may respond by putting a disclaimer on the project's web
site, and may ask that the packager do the same thing in the
appropriate place, so that users of that binary package know what they
are getting is not exactly the same as what the project officially
released.  There need be no animosity in such a situation, though
unfortunately there often is.  It's just that packagers have a
slightly different set of goals from developers.  The packagers mainly
want the best out-of-the-box experience for their users.  The
developers want that too, of course, but they also need to ensure that
they know what versions of the software are out there, so they can
receive coherent bug reports and make compatibility guarantees.
Sometimes these goals conflict.  When they do, it's good to keep in
mind that the project has no control over the packagers, and that the
bonds of obligation run both ways.  It's true that the project is
doing the packagers a favor simply by producing the software.  But the
packagers are also doing the project a favor, by taking on a mostly
unglamorous job in order to make the software more widely available,
often by orders of magnitude.  It's fine to disagree with packagers,
but don't flame them; just try to work things out as best you
can.</p></div></div></body></html>
