branch, the public part of the release process begins.  But before the
tarball is made available to the world at large, it should be tested
and approved by some minimum number of developers, usually three or
more.  Approval is not simply a matter of inspecting the release for
obvious flaws; ideally, the developers download the tarball, build and
install it onto a clean system, run the regression test suite (see
<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#automated-testing" title="Automated testing">the section called “Automated testing”</a>)<span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Managing Volunteers">Chapter 8, <em>Managing Volunteers</em></a></span>, and do some
manual testing.  Assuming it passes these checks, as well as any other
release checklist criteria the project may have, the developers then
digitally sign the tarball using GnuPG
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a>), PGP
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pgpi.org/">http://www.pgpi.org/</a>), or some other program capable
of producing PGP-compatible signatures.</p><p>In most projects, the developers just use their personal digital
signatures, instead of a shared project key, and as many developers as
want to may sign (i.e., there is a minimum number, but not a maximum).
The more developers sign, the more testing the release undergoes, and
also the greater the likelihood that a security-conscious user can
find a digital trust path from herself to the tarball.</p><p>Once approved, the release (that is, all tarballs, zip files,
and whatever other formats are being distributed) should be placed
into the project's download area, accompanied by the digital
signatures, and by MD5/SHA1 checksums (see <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function</a>).
There are various standards for doing this.  One way is to accompany
each released package with a file giving the corresponding digital
signatures, and another file giving the checksum.  For example, if one
of the released packages is <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code>,
place in the same directory a file
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.asc</code> containing the digital
signature for that tarball, another file
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.md5</code> containing its MD5
checksum, and optionally another,
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.sha1</code>, containing the SHA1
checksum.  A different way to provide checking is to collect all the
signatures for all the released packages into a single file,
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.sigs</code>; the same may be done with the
checksums.</p><p>It doesn't really matter which way you do it.  Just keep to a
simple scheme, describe it clearly, and be consistent from release to
release.  The purpose of all this signing and checksumming is to give
users a way to verify that the copy they receive has not been
maliciously tampered with.  Users are about to run this code on their
computers—if the code has been tampered with, an attacker could
suddenly have a back door to all their data.  See
<a class="xref" href="ch07s06.html#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called “Security Releases”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span> for more about paranoia.</p><div class="sect2" title="Candidate Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="candidate-releases"/>Candidate Releases</h2></div></div></div><p>For important releases containing many changes, many projects
prefer to put out <em class="firstterm">release candidates</em> first,
e.g., <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta1</code> before
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code>.  The purpose of a candidate is to
subject the code to wide testing before blessing it as an official
release.  If problems are found, they are fixed on the release branch
and a new candidate release is rolled out
(<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta2</code>).  The cycle continues until
no unacceptable bugs are left, at which point the last candidate
release becomes the official release—that is, the only
difference between the last candidate release and the real release
is the removal of the qualifier from the version number.</p><p>In most other respects, a candidate release should be treated
the same as a real release.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>alpha</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>beta</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>rc</em></span> qualifier is
enough to warn conservative users to wait until the real release, and
of course the announcement emails for the candidate releases should
point out that their purpose is to solicit feedback.  Other than
that, give candidate releases the same amount of care as regular
releases.  After all, you want people to use the candidates, because
exposure is the best way to uncover bugs, and also because you never
know which candidate release will end up becoming the official
release.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Announcing Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="release-announcement"/>Announcing Releases</h2></div></div></div><p>Announcing a release is like announcing any other event, and
should use the procedures described in
<a class="xref" href="ch06s06.html" title="Publicity">the section called “Publicity”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span>.  There are a few
specific things to do for releases, though.</p><p>Whenever you give the URL to the downloadable release tarball,
make sure to also give the MD5/SHA1 checksums and pointers to the
digital signatures file.  Since the announcement happens in multiple
forums (mailing list, news page, etc.), this means users can get the
checksums from multiple sources, which gives the most
security-conscious among them extra assurance that the checksums
themselves have not been tampered with.  Giving the link to the
digital signature files multiple times doesn't make those signatures
more secure, but it does reassure people (especially those who don't
follow the project closely) that the project takes security
seriously.</p><p>In the announcement email, and on news pages that contain more
than just a blurb about the release, make sure to include the relevant
portion of the CHANGES file, so people can see why it might be in
their interests to upgrade.  This is as important with candidate
releases as with final releases; the presence of bugfixes and new
features is important in tempting people to try out a candidate
release.</p><p>Finally, don't forget to thank the development team, the
testers, and all the people who took the time to file good bug
reports.  Don't single out anyone by name, though, unless there's
someone who is individually responsible for a huge piece of work,
the value of which is widely recognized by everyone in the
project.  Just be wary of sliding down the slippery slope of credit
inflation (see <a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html" title="Credit">the section called “Credit”</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Managing Volunteers">Chapter 8, <em>Managing Volunteers</em></a></span>).</p></div></div></body></html>
