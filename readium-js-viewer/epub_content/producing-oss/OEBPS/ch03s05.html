Relay Chat</em> (<em class="firstterm">IRC</em>), forums where users
and developers can ask each other questions and get instant responses.
While you <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> run an IRC server from your own
web site, it is generally not worth the hassle.  Instead, do what
everyone else does: run your IRC channels at Freenode
(<a class="ulink" href="http://freenode.net/">http://freenode.net/</a>).  Freenode gives you the control
you need to administer your project's IRC
channels,<sup>[<a id="idp5874064" href="#ftn.idp5874064" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup> while
sparing you the not-insignificant trouble of maintaining an IRC server
yourself.</p><p>The first thing to do is choose a channel name.  The most
obvious choice is the name of your project—if that's available
at Freenode, then use it.  If not, try to choose something as close to
your project's name, and as easy to remember, as possible.  Advertise
the channel's availabity from your project's web site, so a visitor
with a quick question will see it right away.  For example, this
appears in a prominently placed box at the top of Subversion's home
page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If you're using Subversion, we recommend that you
    join the</em></span> <code class="literal">users@subversion.tigris.org</code>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>mailing list, and read the <a class="ulink" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion Book</a> and
    <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html">FAQ</a>.
    You can also ask questions on IRC at</em></span>
    <code class="literal">irc.freenode.net</code>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>channel</em></span> <code class="literal">#svn</code>.</p></blockquote></div><p>Some projects have multiple channels, one per subtopic.  For
example, one channel for installation problems, another for usage
questions, another for development chat, etc. (<a class="xref" href="ch06s04.html" title="Handling Growth">the section called “Handling Growth”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span> discusses and how to
divide into multiple channels).  When your project is young, there
should only be one channel, with everyone talking together.  Later, as
the user-to-developer ratio increases, separate channels may become
necessary.</p><p>How will people know all the available channels, let alone which
channel to talk in?  And when they talk, how will they know what the
local conventions are?</p><p>The answer is to tell them by setting the <em class="firstterm">channel
topic</em>.<sup>[<a id="idp5884208" href="#ftn.idp5884208" class="footnote">18</a>]</sup>  The channel topic is a brief
message each user sees when they first enter the channel.  It gives
quick guidance to newcomers, and pointers to further information.  For
example:</p><pre class="screen">
You are now talking on #svn

Topic for #svn is Forum for Subversion user questions, see also
http://subversion.tigris.org/. || Development discussion happens in
#svn-dev. || Please don't paste long transcripts here, instead use
a pastebin site like http://pastebin.ca/. || NEWS: Subversion 1.1.0
is released, see http://svn110.notlong.com/ for details.
</pre><p>That's terse, but it tells newcomers what they need to know.  It
says exactly what the channel is for, gives the project home page (in
case someone wanders into the channel without having first been to the
project web site), mentions a related channel, and gives some guidance
about pasting.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Paste Sites"><a id="paste-sites"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Paste Sites</strong></p></div></div></div><p>An IRC channel is a shared space: everyone can see what everyone
else is saying.  Normally, this is a good thing, as it allows people
to jump into a conversation when they think they have something to
contribute, and allows spectators to learn by watching.  But it
becomes problematic when someone has to provide a large quantity of
information at once, such as a debugging session transcript, because
pasting too many lines of output into the channel will disrupt other
conversations.</p><p>The solution is to use one of the
<em class="firstterm">pastebin</em> or <em class="firstterm">pastebot</em>
sites.  When requesting a large amount of data from someone, ask them
not to paste it into the channel, but instead to go to (for example)
<a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.ca/">http://pastebin.ca/</a>, paste their data into the form
there, and tell the resulting new URL to the IRC channel.  Anyone can
then visit the URL and view the data.</p><p>There are a number of free paste sites available now, too many
for a comprehensive list, but here are some of the ones I've seen used:
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.nomorepasting.com/">http://www.nomorepasting.com/</a>,
<a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.ca/">http://pastebin.ca/</a>,

and

a so-called <em class="firstterm">bot</em>, that is capable of storing and
regurgitating information in response to specific commands.
Typically, the bot is addressed just like any other member of the
channel, that is, the commands are delivered by "speaking to" the bot.
For example:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; ayita: learn diff-cmd = http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  Thanks!
</pre><p>That told the bot (who is logged into the channel as ayita) to
remember a certain URL as the answer to the query "diff-cmd".  Now we
can address ayita, asking the bot to tell another user about
diff-cmd:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; ayita: tell jrandom about diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  jrandom: http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre><p>The same thing can be accomplished via a convenient shorthand:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; !a jrandom diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  jrandom: http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre><p>The exact command set and behaviors differ from bot to bot.  The
above example is with <code class="literal">ayita</code>
(<a class="ulink" href="http://hix.nu/svn-public/alexis/trunk/">http://hix.nu/svn-public/alexis/trunk/</a>), of which
there is usually an instance running in <code class="literal">#svn</code> at
freenode.  Other bots include Dancer
(<a class="ulink" href="http://dancer.sourceforge.net/">http://dancer.sourceforge.net/</a>) and Supybot
(<a class="ulink" href="http://supybot.com/">http://supybot.com/</a>).  Note that no special server
privileges are required to run a bot.  A bot is a client program;
anyone can set one up and direct it to listen to a particular
server/channel.</p><p>If your channel tends to get the same questions over and over,
I highly recommend setting up a bot.  Only a small percentage of
channel users will acquire the expertise needed to manipulate the bot,
but those users will answer a disproportionately high percentage of
questions, because the bot enables them to respond so much more
efficiently.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Archiving IRC"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="irc-archiving"/>Archiving IRC</h2></div></div></div><p>Although it is possible to archive everything that happens in an
IRC channel, it's not necessarily expected.  IRC conversations may be
nominally public, but many people think of them as informal,
semi-private conversations.  Users may be careless with grammar, and
often express opinions (for example, about other software or other
programmers) that they wouldn't want preserved forever in an online
archive.</p><p>Of course, there will sometimes be <span class="emphasis"><em>excerpts</em></span>
that should be preserved, and that's fine.  Most IRC clients can log a
conversation to a file at the user's request, or failing that, one can
always just cut and paste the conversation from IRC into a more
permanent forum (most often the bug tracker).  But indiscriminate
logging may make some users uneasy.  If you do archive everything,
make sure you state so clearly in the channel topic, and give a URL to
the archive.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp5874064" href="#idp5874064" class="para">17</a>] </sup>There is no requirement or expectation that
