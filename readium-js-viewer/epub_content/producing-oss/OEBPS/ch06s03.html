than they are in person.  By "difficult" I don't mean "rude".  Rude
people are annoying, but they're not necessarily difficult.  This book
has already discussed how to handle them: comment on the rudeness the
first time, and from then on, either ignore them or treat them the same
as anyone else.  If they continue being rude, they will usually make
themselves so unpopular as to have no influence on others in the
project, so they are a self-containing problem.</p><p>The really difficult cases are people who are not overtly rude,
but who manipulate or abuse the project's processes in a way that ends
up costing other people time and energy, yet do not bring any benefit
to the project<sup>[<a id="idp7078592" href="#ftn.idp7078592" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup>.</p><p>Often, such people look for wedgepoints in the project's
procedures, to give themselves more influence than they might
otherwise have.  This is much more insidious than mere rudeness,
because neither the behavior nor the damage it causes is apparent to
casual observers.  A classic example is the filibuster, in which
someone (always sounding as reasonable as possible, of course) keeps
claiming that the matter under discussion is not ready for resolution,
and offers more and more possible solutions, or new viewpoints on old
solutions, when what is really going on is that he senses that a
consensus or a ballot is about to form and he doesn't like where it's
headed.  Another example is when there's a debate that won't converge
on consensus, but the group tries to at least clarify the points of
disagreement and produce a summary for everyone to refer to from then
on.  The obstructionist, who knows the summary may lead to a result he
doesn't like, will often try to delay even the summary, by
relentlessly complicating the question of what should be in it, either
by objecting to reasonable suggestions or by introducing unexpected
new items.</p><div class="sect2" title="Handling Difficult People"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="handling-difficult-people"/>Handling Difficult People</h2></div></div></div><p>To counteract such behavior, it helps to understand the
mentality of those who engage in it.  People generally do not do it
consciously.  No one wakes up in the morning and says to himself:
"Today I'm going to cynically manipulate procedural forms in order to
be an irritating obstructionist."  Instead, such actions are often
preceded by a semi-paranoid feeling of being shut out of group
interactions and decisions.  The person feels he is not being taken
seriously, or (in the more severe cases) that there is almost a
conspiracy against him—that the other project members have decided to
form an exclusive club, of which he is not a member.  This then
justifies, in his mind, taking rules literally and engaging in a
formal manipulation of the project's procedures, in order
to <span class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span> everyone else take him seriously.  In
extreme cases, the person can even believe that he is fighting a
lonely battle to save the project from itself.</p><p>It is the nature of such an attack from within that not everyone
will notice it at the same time, and some people may not see it at all
unless presented with very strong evidence.  This means that
neutralizing it can be quite a bit of work.  It's not enough to
persuade yourself that it's happening; you have to marshal enough
evidence to persuade others too, and then you have to distribute that
evidence in a thoughtful way.</p><p>Given that it's so much work to fight, it's often better just to
tolerate it for a while.  Think of it like a parasitic but mild
disease: if it's not too debilitating, the project can afford to
remain infected, and medicine might have harmful side effects.
However, if it gets too damaging to tolerate, then it's time for
action.  Start gathering notes on the patterns you see.  Make sure to
include references to public archives—this is one of the reasons
the project keeps records, so you might as well use them.  Once you've
got a good case built, start having private conversations with other
project participants.  Don't tell them what you've observed; instead,
first ask them what they've observed.  This may be your last chance to
get unfiltered feedback about how others see the troublemaker's
behavior; once you start openly talking about it, opinion will
become polarized and no one will be able to remember what he
formerly thought about the matter.</p><p>If private discussions indicate that at least some others see
the problem too, then it's time to do something.  That's when you
have to get <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> cautious, because it's very
easy for this sort of person to try to make it appear as though you're
picking on them unfairly.  Whatever you do, never accuse them of
maliciously abusing the project's procedures, of being paranoid, or, in
general, of any of the other things that you suspect are probably
true.  Your strategy should be to look both more reasonable and more
concerned with the overall welfare of the project, with the goal of
either reforming the person's behavior, or getting them to go away
permanently.  Depending on the other developers, and your relationship
with them, it may be advantageous to gather allies privately first.
Or it may not; that might just create ill will behind the scenes, if
people think you're engaging in an improper whispering
campaign.</p><p>Remember that although the other person may be the one behaving
destructively, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> will be the one who appears
destructive if you make a public charge that you can't back up.  Be
sure to have plenty of examples to demonstrate what you're saying, and
say it as gently as possible while still being direct.  You may not
persuade the person in question, but that's okay as long as you
persuade everyone else.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Case study"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="difficult-people-case-study"/>Case study</h2></div></div></div><p>I remember only one situation, in more than 10 years of working
in free software, where things got so bad that we actually had to ask
someone to stop posting altogether.  As is so often the case, he was
not rude, and sincerely wanted only to be helpful.  He just didn't
know when to post and when not to post.  Our lists were open to the
public, and he was posting so often, and asking questions on so many
different topics, that it was getting to be a noise problem for the
community.  We'd already tried asking him nicely to do a little more
research for answers before posting, but that had no effect.</p><p>The strategy that finally worked is a perfect example of how to
build a strong case on neutral, quantitative data.  One of our
developers did some digging in the archives, and then sent the
following message privately to a few developers.  The offender (the
third name on the list below, shown here as "J. Random") had very
little history with the project, and had contributed no code or
documentation.  Yet he was the third most active poster on the mailing
lists:</p><pre class="screen">
From: "Brian W. Fitzpatrick" &lt;fitz@collab.net&gt;
To: [... recipient list omitted for anonymity ...]
Subject: The Subversion Energy Sink
Date: Wed, 12 Nov 2003 23:37:47 -0600

In the last 25 days, the top 6 posters to the svn [dev|users] list have
been:

    294  kfogel@collab.net
    236  "C. Michael Pilato" &lt;cmpilato@collab.net&gt;
    220  "J. Random" &lt;jrandom@problematic-poster.com&gt;
    176  Branko Čibej &lt;brane@xbc.nu&gt;
    130  Philip Martin &lt;philip@codematters.co.uk&gt;
    126  Ben Collins-Sussman &lt;sussman@collab.net&gt;

I would say that five of these people are contributing to Subversion
hitting 1.0 in the near future.

I would also say that one of these people is consistently drawing time
and energy from the other 5, not to mention the list as a whole, thus
(albeit unintentionally) slowing the development of Subversion.  I did
not do a threaded analysis, but vgrepping my Subversion mail spool tells
me that every mail from this person is responded to at least once by at
least 2 of the other 5 people on the above list.

I think some sort of radical intervention is necessary here, even if we
do scare the aforementioned person away.  Niceties and kindness have
already proven to have no effect.

dev@subversion is a mailing list to facilitate development of a version
control system, not a group therapy session.

 pile up
</pre><p>Though it might not seem so at first, J. Random's behavior was a
classic case of abusing project procedures.  He wasn't doing something
obvious like trying to filibuster a vote, but he was taking advantage
of the mailing list's policy of relying on self-moderation by its
members.  We left it to each individual's judgement when to post and
on what topics.  Thus, we had no procedural recourse for dealing with
someone who either did not have, or would not exercise, such judgement.
There was no rule one could point to and say the fellow was violating
it, yet everyone knew that his frequent posting was getting to be a
serious problem.</p><p>Fitz's strategy was, in retrospect, masterful.  He gathered
damning quantitative evidence, but then distributed it discreetly,
sending it first to a few people whose support would be key in any
drastic action.  They agreed that some sort of action was necessary,
and in the end we called J. Random on the phone, described the problem
to him directly, and asked him to simply stop posting.  He never
really did understand the reasons why; if he had been capable
of understanding, he probably would have exercised appropriate
judgement in the first place.  But he agreed to stop posting, and the
mailing lists became useable again.  Part of the reason this strategy
worked was, perhaps, the implicit threat that we could start
restricting his posts via the moderation software normally used for
preventing spam (see
<a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#spam-prevention" title="Spam Prevention">the section called “Spam Prevention”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Technical Infrastructure">Chapter 3, <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a></span>).  But the
reason we were able to have that option in reserve was that Fitz had
gathered the necessary support from key people first.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp7078592" href="#idp7078592" class="para">22</a>] </sup>For an extended discussion of one
