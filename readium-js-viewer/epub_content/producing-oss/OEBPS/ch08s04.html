source projects, committers deserve special attention here.
Committers are an unavoidable concession to discrimination in a system
which is otherwise as non-discriminatory as possible.  But
"discrimination" is not meant as a pejorative here.  The function
committers perform is utterly necessary, and I do not think a project
could succeed without it.  Quality control requires, well, control.
There are always many people who feel competent to make changes to a
program, and some smaller number who actually are.  The project cannot
rely on people's own judgement; it must impose standards and grant
commit access only to those who meet them<sup>[<a id="idp8356048" href="#ftn.idp8356048" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup>.  On the other
hand, having people who can commit changes directly working
side-by-side with people who cannot sets up an obvious power dynamic.
That dynamic must be managed so that it does not harm the
project.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html#electorate" title="Who Votes?">the section called “Who Votes?”</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter 4, <em>Social and Political Infrastructure</em></a></span>, we already
discussed the mechanics of considering new committers.  Here we will
look at the standards by which potential new committers should be
judged, and how this process should be presented to the larger
community.</p><div class="sect2" title="Choosing Committers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="choosing-committers"/>Choosing Committers</h2></div></div></div><p>In the Subversion project, we choose committers primarily on the
Hippocratic Principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>first, do no harm</em></span>.  Our
main criterion is not technical skill or even knowledge of the code,
but merely that the committer show good judgement.  Judgement can mean
simply knowing what not to take on.  A person might post only small
patches, fixing fairly simple problems in the code; but if the patches
apply cleanly, do not contain bugs, and are mostly in accord with the
project's log message and coding conventions, and there are enough
patches to show a clear pattern, then an existing committer will
usually propose that person for commit access.  If at least three
people say yes, and no one objects, then the offer is made.  True, we
might have no evidence that the person is able to solve complex
problems in all areas of the code base, but that does not matter: the
person has made it clear that he is capable of at least judging
his own abilities.  Technical skills can be learned (and taught),
but judgement, for the most part, cannot.  Therefore, it is the one
thing you want to make sure a person has before you give him commit
access.</p><p>When a new committer proposal does provoke a discussion, it is
usually not about technical ability, but rather about the person's
behavior on the mailing lists or in IRC.  Sometimes someone shows
technical skill and an ability to work within the project's formal
guidelines, yet is also consistently belligerent or uncooperative in
public forums.  That's a serious concern; if the person doesn't
seem to shape up over time, even in response to hints, then we won't
add him as a committer no matter how skilled he is.  In a
volunteer group, social skills, or the ability to "play well in the
sandbox", are as important as raw technical ability.  Because
everything is under version control, the penalty for adding a
committer you shouldn't have is not so much the problems it could
cause in the code (review would spot those quickly anyway), but that
it might eventually force the project to revoke the person's commit
access—an action that is never pleasant and can sometimes be
confrontational.</p><p>Many projects insist that the potential committer demonstrate a
certain level of technical expertise and persistence, by submitting
some number of nontrivial patches—that is, not only do these
projects want to know that the person will do no harm, they want to
know that she is likely to do good across the code base.  This is
fine, but be careful that it doesn't start to turn committership into
a matter of membership in an exclusive club.  The question to keep in
everyone's mind should be "What will bring the best results for the
code?" not "Will we devalue the social status associated with
committership by admitting this person?"  The point of commit access
is not to reinforce people's self-worth, it's to allow good changes to
enter the code with a minimum of fuss.  If you have 100
committers, 10 of whom make large changes on a regular basis, and the
other 90 of whom just fix typos and small bugs a few times a year,
that's still better than having only the 10.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Revoking Commit Access"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="revoking-committers"/>Revoking Commit Access</h2></div></div></div><p>The first thing to be said about revoking commit access is: try
not to be in that situation in the first place.  Depending on whose
access is being revoked, and why, the discussions around such an
action can be very divisive.  Even when not divisive, they will be a
time-consuming distraction from productive work.</p><p>However, if you must do it, the discussion should be had
privately among the same people who would be in a position to vote for
<span class="emphasis"><em>granting</em></span> that person whatever flavor of commit
access they currently have.  The person herself should not be
included.  This contradicts the usual injunction against secrecy, but
in this case it's necessary.  First, no one would be able to speak
freely otherwise.  Second, if the motion fails, you don't necessarily
want the person to know it was ever considered, because that could
open up questions ("Who was on my side?  Who was against me?") that
lead to the worst sort of factionalism.  In certain rare
circumstances, the group may want someone to know that revocation of
commit access is or was being considered, as a warning, but this
openness should be a decision the group makes.  No one should ever, on
her own initiative, reveal information from a discussion and ballot
that others assumed were secret.</p><p>Once someone's access is revoked, that fact is unavoidably
public (see
<a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html#commit-access-openness" title="Avoid Mystery">the section called “Avoid Mystery”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so try to be as tactful as you can in
how it is presented to the outside world.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Partial Commit Access"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="partial-committers"/>Partial Commit Access</h2></div></div></div><p>Some projects offer gradations of commit access.  For example,
there might be contributors whose commit access gives them free rein
in the documentation, but who do not commit to the code itself.
Common areas for partial commit access include documentation,
translations, binding code to other programming languages,
specification files for packaging (e.g., RedHat RPM spec files,
etc.), and other places where a mistake will not result in a problem for
the core project.</p><p>Since commit access is not only about committing, but about
being part of an electorate (see
<a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html#electorate" title="Who Votes?">the section called “Who Votes?”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter 4, <em>Social and Political Infrastructure</em></a></span>),
the question naturally arises: what can the partial committers vote
on?  There is no one right answer; it depends on what sorts of partial
commit domains your project has.  In Subversion we've kept things
fairly simple: a partial committer can vote on matters confined
exclusively to that committer's domain, and not on anything else.
Importantly, we do have a mechanism for casting advisory votes
(essentially, the committer writes "+0" or "+1 (non-binding)"
instead of just "+1" on the ballot).  There's no reason to silence
people entirely just because their vote isn't formally binding.</p><p>Full committers can vote on anything, just as they can commit
anywhere, and only full committers vote on adding new committers of
any kind.  In practice, though, the ability to add new partial
committers is usually delegated: any full committer can "sponsor" a
new partial committer, and partial committers in a domain can often
essentially choose new committers for that same domain (this is
especially helpful in making translation work run smoothly).</p><p>Your project may need a slightly different arrangement,
depending on the nature of the work, but the same general principles
apply to all projects.  Each committer should be able to vote on
matters that fall within the scope of her commit access, and not on
matters outside that, and votes on procedural questions should default
to the full committers, unless there's some reason (as decided by the
full committers) to widen the electorate.</p><p>Regarding enforcement of partial commit access: it's often
best <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have the version control system
enforce partial commit domains, even if it can.  See
<a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#vc-authz" title="Authorization">the section called “Authorization”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Technical Infrastructure">Chapter 3, <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a></span> for the
reasons why.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Dormant Committers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dormant-committers"/>Dormant Committers</h2></div></div></div><p>Some projects automatically remove people's commit access if
they go a certain amount of time (say, a year) without committing
anything.  I think this is usually unhelpful and even
counterproductive, for two reasons.</p><p>First, it may tempt some people into committing acceptable but
unnecessary changes, just to prevent their commit access from
expiring.  Second, it doesn't really serve any purpose.  If the
main criterion for granting commit access is good judgement, then why
assume someone's judgement would deteriorate just because he's away
from the project for a while?  Even if he completely vanishes for
years, not looking at the code or following development discussions,
when he reappears he'll <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> how out of touch
he is, and act accordingly.  You trusted his judgement before, so
why not trust it always?  If high school diplomas do not expire, then
commit access certainly shouldn't.</p><p>Sometimes a committer may ask to be removed, or to be explicitly
marked as dormant in the list of committers (see
<a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html#commit-access-openness" title="Avoid Mystery">the section called “Avoid Mystery”</a><span>
below</span> for more about that list).  In these cases, the project
should accede to the person's wishes, of course.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Avoid Mystery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="commit-access-openness"/>Avoid Mystery</h2></div></div></div><p>Although the discussions around adding any particular new
committer must be confidential, the rules and procedures themselves
need not be secret.  In fact, it's best to publish them, so people
realize that the committers are not some mysterious Star Chamber,
closed off to mere mortals, but that anyone can join simply by posting
good patches and knowing how to handle herself in the community.
In the Subversion project, we put this information right in the
developer guidelines document, since the people most likely to be
interested in how commit access is granted are those thinking of
contributing code to the project.</p><p>In addition to publishing the procedures, publish the
actual <span class="emphasis"><em>list</em></span> of committers.  The traditional place
for this is a file called <code class="filename">MAINTAINERS</code>
or <code class="filename">COMMITTERS</code> in the top level of the project's
source code tree.  It should list all the full committers first,
followed by the various partial commit domains and the members of each
domain.  Each person should be listed by name and email address,
though the address can be encoded to prevent spam (see
<a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#address-hiding" title="Address hiding in archives">the section called “Address hiding in archives”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Technical Infrastructure">Chapter 3, <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a></span>) if the
person prefers that.</p><p>Since the distinction between full commit and partial commit
access is obvious and well defined, it is proper for the list to make
that distinction too.  Beyond that, the list should not try to
indicate the informal distinctions that inevitably arise in a project,
such as who is particularly influential and how.  It is a public
record, not an acknowledgments file.  List committers either in
alphabetical order, or in the order in which they arrived.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp8356048" href="#idp8356048" class="para">28</a>] </sup>Note that the
commit access means something a bit different in decentralized version
control systems, where anyone can set up a repository that is linked
into the project, and give themselves commit access to that
repository.  Nevertheless, the <span class="emphasis"><em>concept</em></span> of commit
access still applies: "commit access" is shorthand for "the
right to make changes to the code that will ship in the group's next
release of the software."  In centralized version control systems,
this means having direct commit access; in decentralized ones, it
means having one's changes pulled into the main distribution by
default.  It is the same idea either way; the mechanics by which it is
realized are not terribly important.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
