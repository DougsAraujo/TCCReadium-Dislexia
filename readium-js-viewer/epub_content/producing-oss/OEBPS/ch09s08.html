licensing issues.  Although I hope it contains enough information to
get you started on your own open source project, any serious
investigation of licensing issues will quickly exhaust what this book
can provide.  Here is a list of further resources on open source
licensing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><em class="citetitle">Understanding Open Source and Free
            Software Licensing</em> by Andrew M. St. Laurent.
            Published by O'Reilly Media, first edition August 2004,
            ISBN:Â 0-596-00581-4.</p><p>This is a full-length book on open source licensing
            in all its complexity, including many topics omitted from
            this chapter.  See

            for details.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><em class="citetitle">Make Your Open Source Software
            GPL-Compatible.  Or Else.</em> by David
            A. Wheeler, at
            <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html</a>.</p><p>This is a detailed and well-written article on why
            it is important to use a GPL-compatible license even if
            you don't use the GPL itself.  The article also touches on
            many other licensing questions, and has a high density of
            excellent links.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org/</a></p><p>Creative Commons is an organization that promotes a
            range of more flexible and liberal copyrights than
            traditional copyright practice encourages.  They offer
            licenses not just for software, but for text, art, and
            music as well, all accessible via a user-friendly license
            selector; some of the licenses are copylefts, some are
            non-copyleft but still free, others are simply traditional
            copyrights but with some restrictions relaxed.  The
            Creative Commons web site gives extremely clear
            explanations of what it's about.  If I had to pick one
            site to demonstrate the broader philosophical implications
            of the free software movement, this would be it.</p></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
