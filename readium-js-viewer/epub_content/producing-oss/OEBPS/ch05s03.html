forums as individual participants, rather than as a monolithic
corporate presence.  This is not because there is some negative
connotation inherent in monolithic corporate presences (well, perhaps
there is, but that's not what this book is about).  Rather, it's
because individuals are the only sort of entity open source projects
are structurally equipped to deal with.  An individual contributor can
have discussions, submit patches, acquire credibility, vote, and so
forth.  A company cannot.</p><p>Furthermore, by behaving in a decentralized manner, you avoid
stimulating centralization of opposition.  Let your developers
disagree with each other on the mailing lists.  Encourage them to
review each other's code as often, and as publicly, as they would
anyone else's.  Discourage them from always voting as a bloc, because
if they do, others may start to feel that, just on general principles,
there should be an organized effort to keep them in check.</p><p>There's a difference between actually being decentralized and
simply striving to appear that way.  Under certain circumstances,
having your developers behave in concert can be quite useful, and they
should be prepared to coordinate behind the scenes when necessary.
For example, when making a proposal, having several people chime in
with agreement early on can help it along, by giving the impression of
a growing consensus.  Others will feel that the proposal has momentum,
and that if they were to object, they'd be stopping that momentum.
Thus, people will object only if they have a good reason to do so.
There's nothing wrong with orchestrating agreement like this, as long
as objections are still taken seriously.  The public manifestations of
a private agreement are no less sincere for having been coordinated
beforehand, and are not harmful as long as they are not used to
prejudicially snuff out opposing arguments.  Their purpose is merely
to inhibit the sort of people who like to object just to stay in
shape; see <a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">the section called “The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate”</a><span>
