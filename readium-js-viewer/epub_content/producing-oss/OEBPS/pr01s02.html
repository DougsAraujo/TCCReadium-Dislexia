considering starting an open source project, or who have started one
and are wondering what to do now.  It should also be helpful for
people who just want to participate in an open source project but have
never done so before.</p><p>The reader need not be a programmer, but should know basic
software engineering concepts such as source code, compilers, and
patches.</p><p>Prior experience with open source software, as either a user or
a developer, is not necessary.  Those who have worked in free software
projects before will probably find at least some parts of the book a
bit obvious, and may want to skip those sections.  Because there's
such a potentially wide range of audience experience, I've made an
effort to label sections clearly, and to say when something can be
skipped by those already familiar with the material.</p></div></body></html>
