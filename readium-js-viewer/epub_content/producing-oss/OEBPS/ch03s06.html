mechanism for distributing meta-data-rich news summaries to
"subscribers", that is, people who have indicated an interest in
receiving those summaries.  A given RSS source is usually called
a <em class="firstterm">feed</em>, and the user's subscription interface
is called a <em class="firstterm">feed reader</em> or <em class="firstterm">feed
aggregator</em>.  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS
Bandit</a> and the eponymous
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.feedreader.com/">Feedreader</a> are two
open source RSS readers, for example.</p><p>There is not space here for a detailed technical explanation of
RSS<sup>[<a id="idp5913792" href="#ftn.idp5913792" class="footnote">19</a>]</sup>, but you should be aware of two main
things.  First, the feed reading software is chosen by the subscriber
and is <span class="emphasis"><em>the same</em></span> for all the feeds that subscriber
monitors — in fact, this is the major selling point of
RSS: that the subscriber chooses one interface to use for all their
feeds, so each feed can concentrate just on delivering content.
Second, RSS is now ubiquitous, so much so that most people who use it
don't even know they're using it.  To the world at large, RSS looks
like a little button on a web page, with a label saying "Subscribe to
this site" or "News feed".  You click on the button, and from then on,
your feed reader (which may well be an applet embedded in your home
page) automatically updates whenever there's news from the
site.</p><p>This means that your open source project should probably offer
an RSS feed (note that many of the canned hosting
sites — see
<a class="xref" href="ch03s08.html#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the section called “Canned Hosting”</a> — offer it right out
of the box).  Be careful not to post so many news items each day that
subscribers can't separate the wheat from the chaff.  If there are too
many news events, people will just ignore the feed, or even
unsubscribe in exasperation.  Ideally, a project would offer separate
feeds, one for big announcements, another following (say) events in
the issue tracker, another for each mailing list, etc.  In practice,
this is hard to do well: it can result in interface confusion both for
visitors to the project's web site and for the administrators.  But at
a minimum, the project should offer one RSS feed on the front page,
for sending out major announcements such as releases and security
alerts.<sup>[<a id="idp5916864" href="#ftn.idp5916864" class="footnote">20</a>]</sup></p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp5913792" href="#idp5913792" class="para">19</a>] </sup>See
