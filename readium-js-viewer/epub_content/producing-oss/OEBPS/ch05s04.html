compromising business secrets.  If you want the project to acquire a
certain feature because, say, your customers have been clamoring for
it, just say so outright on the mailing lists.  If the customers wish
to remain anonymous, as is sometimes the case, then at least ask them
if they can be used as unnamed examples.  The more the public
development community knows about <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you want
what you want, the more comfortable they'll be with whatever you're
proposing.</p><p>This runs counter to the instinct—so easy to acquire, so
hard to shake off—that knowledge is power, and that the more
others know about your goals, the more control they have over you.
But that instinct would be wrong here.  By publicly advocating the
feature (or bugfix, or whatever it is), you have
<span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> laid your cards on the table.  The only
question now is whether you will succeed in guiding the community to
share your goal.  If you merely state that you want it, but can't
provide concrete examples of why, your argument is weak, and people
will start to suspect a hidden agenda.  But if you give just a few
real-world scenarios showing why the proposed feature is important,
that can have a dramatic effect on the debate.</p><p>To see why this is so, consider the alternative.  Too
frequently, debates about new features or new directions are long and
tiresome.  The arguments people advance often reduce to "I personally
want X," or the ever-popular "In my years of experience as a software
designer, X is extremely important to users / a useless frill that
will please no one."  Predictably, the absence of real-world usage
data neither shortens nor tempers such debates, but instead allows
them to drift farther and farther from any mooring in actual user
experience.  Without some countervailing force, the end result is as
likely as not to be determined by whoever was the most articulate, or
the most persistent, or the most senior.</p><p>As an organization with plentiful customer data available, you
have the opportunity to provide just such a countervailing force.  You
can be a conduit for information that might otherwise have no means of
reaching the development community.  The fact that the information
supports your desires is nothing to be embarrassed about.  Most
developers don't individually have very broad experience with how the
software they write is used.  Each developer uses the software in
her own idiosyncratic way; as far as other usage patterns go, she's
relying on intuition and guesswork, and deep down, she knows
this.  By providing credible data about a significant number of users,
you are giving the public development community something akin to
oxygen.  As long as you present it right, they will welcome it
enthusiastically, and it will propel things in the direction you want
to go.</p><p>The key, of course, is presenting it right.  It will never do to
insist that simply because you deal with a large number of users, and
because they need (or think they need) a given feature, therefore
your solution ought to be implemented.  Instead, you should focus your
initial posts on the problem, rather than on one particular solution.
Describe in great detail the experiences your customers are
encountering, offer as much analysis as you have available, and as
many reasonable solutions as you can think of.  When people start
speculating about the effectiveness of various solutions, you can
continue to draw on your data to support or refute what they say.  You
may have one particular solution in mind all along, but don't single
it out for special consideration at first.  This is not deception, it
is simply standard "honest broker" behavior.  After all, your true
goal is to solve the problem; a solution is merely a means to that
end.  If the solution you prefer really is superior, other developers
will recognize that on their own eventually—and then they will
get behind it of their own free will, which is much better than you
browbeating them into implementing it.  (There is also the possibility
that they will think of a better solution.)</p><p>This is not to say that you can't ever come out in favor of a
specific solution.  But you must have the patience to see the analysis
you've already done internally repeated on the public development
lists.  Don't post saying "Yes, we've been over all that here, but it
doesn't work for reasons A, B, and C.  When you get right down to it,
the only way to solve this is..."  The problem is not so much that it
sounds arrogant as that it gives the impression that you have
<span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> devoted some unknown (but, people will
presume, large) amount of analytical resources to the problem, behind
closed doors.  It makes it seem as though efforts have been going on,
and perhaps decisions made, that the public is not privy to, and that
is a recipe for resentment.</p><p>Naturally, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> know how much effort you've
devoted to the problem internally, and that knowledge is, in a way, a
disadvantage.  It puts your developers in a slightly different mental
space than everyone else on the mailing lists, reducing their ability
to see things from the point of view of those who haven't yet thought
about the problem as much.  The earlier you can get everyone else
thinking about things in the same terms as you do, the smaller this
distancing effect will be.  This logic applies not only to individual
technical situations, but to the broader mandate of making your goals
as clear as you can.  The unknown is always more destabilizing than
the known.  If people understand why you want what you want, they'll
feel comfortable talking to you even when they disagree.  If they
can't figure out what makes you tick, they'll assume the worst, at
least some of the time.</p><p>You won't be able to publicize everything, of course, and people
won't expect you to.  All organizations have secrets; perhaps
for-profits have more of them, but nonprofits have them too.  If you
must advocate a certain course, but can't reveal anything about why,
then simply offer the best arguments you can under that handicap, and
accept the fact that you may not have as much influence as you want in
the discussion.  This is one of the compromises you make in order to
have a development community not on your payroll.</p></div></body></html>
