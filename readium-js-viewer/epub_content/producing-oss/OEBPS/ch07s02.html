a state of continuous release.  Developers usually run the latest
available code at all times, because they want to spot bugs, and
because they follow the project closely enough to be able to stay away
from currently unstable areas of the feature space.  They often update
their copy of the software every day, sometimes more than once a day,
and when they check in a change, they can reasonably expect that every
other developer will have it within 24 hours.</p><p>How, then, should the project make a formal release?  Should it
simply take a snapshot of the tree at a moment in time, package it up,
and hand it to the world as, say, version "3.5.0"?  Common sense says
no.  First, there may be no moment in time when the entire development
tree is clean and ready for release.  Newly-started features could be
lying around in various states of completion.  Someone might have
checked in a major change to fix a bug, but the change could be
controversial and under debate at the moment the snapshot is taken.
If so, it wouldn't work to simply delay the snapshot until the debate
ends, because another, unrelated debate could start in the meantime,
and then you'd have wait for <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> one to end too.
This process is not guaranteed to halt.</p><p>In any case, using full-tree snapshots for releases would
interfere with ongoing development work, even if the tree could be put
into a releasable state.  Say this snapshot is going to be "3.5.0";
presumably, the next snapshot would be "3.5.1", and would contain
mostly fixes for bugs found in the 3.5.0 release.  But if both are
snapshots from the same tree, what are the developers supposed to do
in the time between the two releases?  They can't be adding new
features; the compatibility guidelines prevent that.  But not everyone
will be enthusiastic about fixing bugs in the 3.5.0 code.  Some people
may have new features they're trying to complete, and will become
irate if they are forced to choose between sitting idle and working on
things they're not interested in, just because the project's release
processes demand that the development tree remain unnaturally
quiescent.</p><p>The solution to these problems is to always use
a <em class="firstterm">release branch</em>.  A release branch is just a
branch in the version control system (see
<a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#vc-vocabulary-branch"><em class="firstterm">branch</em></a>), on which the code
destined for this release can be isolated from mainline development.
The concept of release branches is certainly not original to free
software; many commercial development organizations use them too.
However, in commercial environments, release branches are sometimes
considered a luxury—a kind of formal "best practice" that can,
in the heat of a major deadline, be dispensed with while everyone on
the team scrambles to stabilize the main tree.</p><p>Release branches are pretty much required in open source
projects, however.  I have seen projects do releases without them, but
it has always resulted in some developers sitting idle while
others—usually a minority—work on getting the release out
the door.  The result is usually bad in several ways.  First, overall
development momentum is slowed.  Second, the release is of poorer
quality than it needed to be, because there were only a few people
working on it, and they were hurrying to finish so everyone else could
get back to work.  Third, it divides the development team
psychologically, by setting up a situation in which different types of
work interfere with each other unnecessarily.  The developers sitting
idle would probably be happy to contribute <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span>
of their attention to a release branch, as long as that were a choice
they could make according to their own schedules and interests.  But
without the branch, their choice becomes "Do I participate in the
project today or not?"  instead of "Do I work on the release today, or
work on that new feature I've been developing in the mainline
code?"</p><div class="sect2" title="Mechanics of Release Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="release-branch-mechanics"/>Mechanics of Release Branches</h2></div></div></div><p>The exact mechanics of creating a release branch depend on your
version control system, of course, but the general concepts are the
same in most systems.  A branch usually sprouts from another branch or
from the trunk.  Traditionally, the trunk is where mainline
development goes on, unfettered by release constraints.  The first
release branch, the one leading to the "1.0" release, sprouts off the
trunk.  In CVS, the branch command would be something like this</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd trunk-working-copy
$ cvs tag -b RELEASE_1_0_X
</pre><p>or in Subversion, like this:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://.../repos/trunk http://.../repos/branches/1.0.x
</pre><p>(All these examples assume a three-component release numbering
system.  While I can't show the exact commands for every version
control system, I'll give examples in CVS and Subversion and hope that
the corresponding commands in other systems can be deduced from those
two.)</p><p>Notice that we created branch "1.0.x" (with a literal "x")
instead of "1.0.0".  This is because the same minor line—i.e.,
the same branch—will be used for all the micro releases in that
line.  The actual process of stabilizing the branch for release is
covered in
<a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html" title="Stabilizing a Release">the section called “Stabilizing a Release”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>.  Here we are
concerned just with the interaction between the version control system
and the release process.  When the release branch is stabilized and
ready, it is time to tag a snapshot from the branch:</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd RELEASE_1_0_X-working-copy
$ cvs tag RELEASE_1_0_0
</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://.../repos/branches/1.0.x http://.../repos/tags/1.0.0
</pre><p>That tag now represents the exact state of the project's source
tree in the 1.0.0 release (this is useful in case anyone ever needs to
get an old version after the packaged distributions and binaries have
been taken down).  The next micro release in the same line is likewise
prepared on the 1.0.x branch, and when it is ready, a tag is made for
1.0.1.  Lather, rinse, repeat for 1.0.2, and so on.  When it's time to
start thinking about a 1.1.x release, make a new branch from
trunk:</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd trunk-working-copy
$ cvs tag -b RELEASE_1_1_X
</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://.../repos/trunk http://.../repos/branches/1.1.x
</pre><p>Maintenance can continue in parallel along both 1.0.x and 1.1.x,
and releases can be made independently from both lines.  In fact, it
is not unusual to publish near-simultaneous releases from two
different lines.  The older series is recommended for more
conservative site administrators, who may not want to make the big
jump to (say) 1.1 without careful preparation.  Meanwhile, more
adventurous people usually take the most recent release on the highest
line, to make sure they're getting the latest features, even at the
risk of greater instability.</p></div><p>This is not the only release branch strategy, of course.  In
some circumstances it may not even be the best, though it's worked out
pretty well for projects I've been involved in.  Use any strategy that
seems to work, but remember the main points: the purpose of a release
branch is to isolate release work from the fluctuations of daily
development, and to give the project a physical entity around which to
organize its release process.  That process is described in detail in
the next section.</p></div></body></html>
