proprietary-incompatible and proprietary-compatible licenses, that is,
between the GNU General Public License and everything else.  Because
the primary goal of the GPL's authors is the promotion of free
software, they deliberately crafted the license to make it impossible
to mix GPLed code into proprietary programs.  Specifically, among the
GPL's requirements (see
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html</a> for its
full text) are these two:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Any derivative work—that is, any work
            containing a nontrivial amount of GPLed code—must
            itself be distributed under the GPL.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>No additional restrictions may be placed on the
            redistribution of either the original work or a derivative
            work.  (The exact language is: "You may not impose any
            further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
            or affirmed under this License.")</p></li></ol></div><p>With these conditions, the GPL succeeds in making freedom
contagious.  Once a program is copyrighted under the GPL, its terms of
redistribution are <em class="firstterm">viral</em>—they are passed
on to anything else the code gets incorporated into, making it
effectively impossible to use GPLed code in closed-source programs.
However, these same clauses also make the GPL incompatible with
certain other free licenses.  The usual way this happens is that the
other license imposes a requirement—for example, a credit clause
requiring the original authors to be mentioned in some way—that
is incompatible with the GPL's "You may not impose any further
restrictions..." language.  From the point of view of the Free
Software Foundation, these second-order consequences are desirable, or
at least not regrettable.  The GPL not only keeps your software free,
but effectively makes your software an agent in pushing
<span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> software to enforce freedom as well.</p><p>The question of whether or not this is a good way to
promote free software is one of the most persistent holy wars on the
Internet (see <a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">the section called “Avoid Holy Wars”</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span>), and we won't
investigate it here.  What's important for our purposes is that
GPL compatibility is an important issue when choosing a license.  The
GPL is by far the most popular open source license; at one point
Freecode had it at 68%, with the next highest license at 6%
<sup>[<a id="idp8796176" href="#ftn.idp8796176" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup>.
If you want your code to be able to be
mixed freely with GPLed code—and there's a lot of GPLed code out
there—then you should pick a GPL-compatible license.  Most of
the GPL-compatible open source licenses are also
proprietary-compatible: that is, code under such a license can be used
in a GPLed program, and it can be used in a proprietary program.  Of
course, the <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span> of these mixings would not be
compatible with each other, since one would be under the GPL and the
other would be under a closed-source license.  But that concern
applies only to the derivative works, not to the code you distribute
in the first place.</p><p>Fortunately, the Free Software Foundation maintains a list
showing which licenses are compatible with the GPL and which are not,
at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>.  All
of the licenses discussed in this chapter are present on that list, on
one side or the other.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp8796176" href="#idp8796176" class="para">30</a>] </sup>License statistics used to be available from
Freecode.com, back when it was called Freshmeat.net, but in 2008 they
switched to a freeform method of tagging projects that made it harder
to generate reliable license statistics.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://help.freecode.com/discussions/questions/187-where-did-the-license-statistics-page-go">http://help.freecode.com/discussions/questions/187-where-did-the-license-statistics-page-go</a>
