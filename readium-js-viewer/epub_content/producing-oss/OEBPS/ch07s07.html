for how daily development is done.  In particular, it makes
practically mandatory a discipline that would be recommended anyway:
have each commit be a single logical change, and never mix unrelated
changes in the same commit.  If a change is too big or too disruptive
to do in one commit, break it across N commits, where each commit is a
well-partitioned subset of the overall change, and includes nothing
unrelated to the overall change.</p><p>Here's an example of an ill-thought-out commit:</p><pre class="screen">

Fix Issue #1729: Make indexing gracefully warn the user when a file
is changing as it is being indexed.

* ui/repl.py
  (ChangingFile): New exception class.
  (DoIndex): Handle new exception.

* indexer/index.py
  (FollowStream): Raise new exception if file changes during indexing.
  (BuildDir): Unrelatedly, remove some obsolete comments, reformat
  some code, and fix the error check when creating a directory.

Other unrelated cleanups:

* www/index.html: Fix some typos, set next release date.

</pre><p>The problem with it becomes apparent as soon as someone needs to
port the <code class="function">BuildDir</code> error check fix over to a
branch for an upcoming maintenance release.  The porter doesn't want
any of the other changes—for example, perhaps the fix to issue
#1729 wasn't approved for the maintenance branch at all, and the
<code class="filename">index.html</code> tweaks would simply be irrelevant
there.  But she cannot easily grab just the
<code class="function">BuildDir</code> change via the version control tool's
merge functionality, because the version control system was told that
that change is logically grouped with all these other unrelated
things.  In fact, the problem would become apparent even before the
merge.  Merely listing the change for voting would become problematic:
instead of just giving the revision number, the proposer would have to
make a special patch or change branch just to isolate the portion of
the commit being proposed.  That would be a lot of work for others to
suffer through, and all because the original committer couldn't be
bothered to break things into logical groups.</p><p>In fact, that commit really should have been
<span class="emphasis"><em>four</em></span> separate commits: one to fix issue
#1729, another to remove obsolete comments and reformat code in
<code class="function">BuildDir</code>, another to fix the error check in
<code class="function">BuildDir</code>, and finally, one to tweak
<code class="filename">index.html</code>.  The third of those commits would be
the one proposed for the maintenance release branch.</p><p>Of course, release stabilization is not the only reason why
having each commit be one logical change is desirable.
Psychologically, a semantically unified commit is easier to review,
and easier to revert if necessary (in some version control systems,
reversion is really a special kind of merge anyway).  A little
up-front discipline on everyone's part can save the project a lot of
headache later.</p><div class="sect2" title="Planning Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="planning"/>Planning Releases</h2></div></div></div><p>One area where open source projects have historically differed
from proprietary projects is in release planning.  Proprietary
projects usually have firmer deadlines.  Sometimes it's because
customers were promised that an upgrade would be available by a
certain date, because the new release needs to be coordinated with
some other effort for marketing purposes, or because the venture
capitalists who invested in the whole thing need to see some results
before they put in any more funding.  Free software projects, on the
other hand, were until recently mostly motivated by amateurism in the
most literal sense: they were written for the love of it.  No one felt
the need to ship before all the features were ready, and why should
they?  It wasn't as if anyone's job was on the line.</p><p>Nowadays, many open source projects are funded by corporations,
and are correspondingly more and more influenced by deadline-conscious
corporate culture.  This is in many ways a good thing, but it can
cause conflicts between the priorities of those developers who are
being paid and those who are volunteering their time.  These conflicts
often happen around the issue of when and how to schedule releases.
The salaried developers who are under pressure will naturally want to
just pick a date when the releases will occur, and have everyone's
activities fall into line.  But the volunteers may have other
agendas—perhaps features they want to complete, or some testing
they want to have done—that they feel the release should wait
on.</p><p>There is no general solution to this problem except discussion
and compromise, of course.  But you can minimize the frequency and
degree of friction caused, by decoupling the proposed
<span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a given release from the date when
it would go out the door.  That is, try to steer discussion toward the
subject of which releases the project will be making in the near- to
medium-term future, and what features will be in them, without at
first mentioning anything about dates, except for rough guesses with
wide margins of error<sup>[<a id="idp7878160" href="#ftn.idp7878160" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup>.  By nailing down feature sets early, you reduce
the complexity of the discussion centered on any individual release,
and therefore improve predictability.  This also creates a kind of
inertial bias against anyone who proposes to expand the definition of
a release by adding new features or other complications.  If the
release's contents are fairly well defined, the onus is on the
proposer to justify the expansion, even though the date of the release
may not have been set yet.</p><p>In his multi-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
<em class="citetitle">Jefferson and His Time</em>, Dumas Malone tells the
story of how Jefferson handled the first meeting held to decide the
organization of the future University of Virginia.  The University had
been Jefferson's idea in the first place, but (as is the case
everywhere, not just in open source projects) many other parties had
climbed on board quickly, each with their own interests and agendas.
When they gathered at that first meeting to hash things out, Jefferson
made sure to show up with meticulously prepared architectural
drawings, detailed budgets for construction and operation, a proposed
curriculum, and the names of specific faculty he wanted to import from
Europe.  No one else in the room was even remotely as prepared; the
group essentially had to capitulate to Jefferson's vision, and the
University was eventually founded more or less in accordance with his
plans.  The facts that construction went far over budget, and that
many of his ideas did not, for various reasons, work out in the end,
were all things Jefferson probably knew perfectly well would happen.
His purpose was strategic: to show up at the meeting with something so
substantive that everyone else would have to fall into the role of
simply proposing modifications to it, so that the overall shape, and
therefore schedule, of the project would be roughly as he
wanted.</p><p>In the case of a free software project, there is no single
"meeting", but instead a series of small proposals made mostly by
means of the issue tracker.  But if you have some credibility in the
project to start with, and you start assigning various features,
enhancements, and bugs to target releases in the issue tracker,
according to some announced overall plan, people will mostly go along
with you.  Once you've got things laid out more or less as you want
them, the conversations about actual release
<span class="emphasis"><em>dates</em></span> will go much more smoothly.</p><p>It is crucial, of course, to never present any individual
decision as written in stone.  In the comments associated with each
assignment of an issue to a specific future release, invite
discussion, dissent, and be genuinely willing to be persuaded whenever
possible.  Never exercise control merely for the sake of exercising
control: the more deeply others participate in the release planning
process (see
<a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html" title="Share Management Tasks as Well as Technical Tasks">the section called “Share Management Tasks as Well as Technical Tasks”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Managing Volunteers">Chapter 8, <em>Managing Volunteers</em></a></span>), the easier it
will be to persuade them to share your priorities on the issues that
really count for you.</p><p>The other way the project can lower tensions around release
planning is to make releases fairly often.  When there's a long time
between releases, the importance of any individual release is
magnified in everyone's minds; people are that much more crushed when
their code doesn't make it in, because they know how long it might be
until the next chance.  Depending on the complexity of the release
process and the nature of your project, somewhere between every three
and six months is usually about the right gap between releases, though
maintenance lines may put out micro releases a bit faster, if there is
demand for them.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp7878160" href="#idp7878160" class="para">23</a>] </sup>For an alternative approach, you
