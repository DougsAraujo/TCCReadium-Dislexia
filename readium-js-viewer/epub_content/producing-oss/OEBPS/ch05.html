environment.  It is aimed not only at developers who are paid to work
on free software projects, but also at their managers, who need to
understand the social dynamics of the development environment.  In the
sections that follow, the addressee ("you") is presumed to be either a
paid developer, or one who manages such developers.  The advice will
often be the same for both; when it's not, the intended audience will
be made clear from context.</p><p>Corporate funding of free software development is not a new
phenomenon.  A lot of development has always been informally
subsidized.  When a system administrator writes a network analysis
tool to help her do her job, then posts it online and gets bug fixes
and feature contributions from other system administrators, what's
happened is that an unofficial consortium has been formed.  The
consortium's funding comes from the sysadmins' salaries, and its
office space and network bandwidth are donated, albeit unknowingly, by
the organizations they work for.  Those organizations benefit from the
investment, of course, although they may not be institutionally aware
of it at first.</p><p>The difference today is that many of these efforts are being
formalized.  Corporations have become conscious of the benefits of
open source software, and started involving themselves more directly
in its development.  Developers too have come to expect that really
important projects will attract at least donations, and possibly even
long-term sponsors.  While the presence of money has not changed the
basic dynamics of free software development, it has greatly changed
the scale at which things happen, both in terms of the number of
developers and time-per-developer.  It has also had effects on how
projects are organized, and on how the parties involved in them
interact.  The issues are not merely about how the money is spent, or
how return on investment is measured.  They are also about management
and process: how can the hierarchical command structures of
corporations and the semi-decentralized volunteer communities of free
software projects work productively with each other?  Will they even
agree on what "productively" means?</p><p>Financial backing is, in general, welcomed by open source
development communities.  It can reduce a project's vulnerability to the
Forces of Chaos, which sweep away so many projects before they really
get off the ground, and therefore it can make people more willing to
give the software a chance—they feel they're investing their
time into something that will still be around six months from now.
After all, credibility is contagious, to a point.  When, say, IBM
backs an open source project, people pretty much assume the project
won't be allowed to fail, and their resultant willingness to devote
effort to it can make that a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>However, funding also brings a perception of control.  If not
handled carefully, money can divide a project into in-group and
out-group developers.  If the unpaid volunteers get the feeling that
design decisions or feature additions are simply available to the
highest bidder, they'll head off to a project that seems more like a
meritocracy and less like unpaid labor for someone else's benefit.
They may never complain overtly on the mailing lists.  Instead, there
will simply be less and less noise from external sources, as the
volunteers gradually stop trying to be taken seriously.  The buzz of
small-scale activity will continue, in the form of bug reports and
occasional small fixes.  But there won't be any large code
contributions or outside participation in design discussions.  People
sense what's expected of them, and live up (or down) to those
expectations.</p><p>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
can't buy influence.  It most certainly can.  The trick is that it
can't buy influence directly.  In a straightforward commercial
transaction, you trade money for what you want.  If you need a feature
added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and it gets done.  In an open
source project, it's not so simple.  You may sign a contract with some
developers, but they'd be fooling themselves—and you—if
they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be accepted by the
development community simply because you paid for it.  The work can
only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits into the
community's vision for the software.  You may have some say in that
vision, but you won't be the only voice.</p><p>So money can't purchase influence, but it can purchase things
that <span class="emphasis"><em>lead to</em></span> influence.  The most obvious example
is programmers.  If good programmers are hired, and they stick around
long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
any other member.  They will have a vote, or if there are many of
them, they will have a voting bloc.  If they are respected in the
project, they will have influence beyond just their votes.  There is
no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either.  After
all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
reason.  Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
else's.  It's just that the weight given to your company's goals will
be determined by its representatives' status in the project, not by
the company's size, budget, or business plan.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Types of Involvement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="types-of-involvement"/>Types of Involvement</h1></div></div></div><p>There are many different reasons open source projects get
funded.  The items in this list aren't mutually exclusive; often a
project's financial backing will result from several, or even all, of
these motivations:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Sharing the burden</span></dt><dd><p>Separate organizations with related software needs often
     find themselves duplicating effort, either by redundantly writing
     similar code in-house, or by purchasing similar products from
     proprietary vendors.  When they realize what's going on, the
     organizations may pool their resources and create (or join) an
     open source project tailored to their needs.  The advantages are
     obvious: the costs of development are divided, but the benefits
     accrue to all.  Although this scenario seems most intuitive for
     nonprofits, it can make strategic sense even for for-profit
     competitors.</p><p>Examples: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openadapter.org/">http://www.openadapter.org/</a>,
     <a class="ulink" href="http://www.koha.org/">http://www.koha.org/</a></p></dd><dt><span class="term">Augmenting services</span></dt><dd><p>When a company sells services which depend on, or are made
     more attractive by, particular open source programs, it is
     naturally in that company's interests to ensure those programs
     are actively maintained.</p><p>Example: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/">CollabNet's</a> support of
     <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a> (disclaimer: that's
     my day job, but it's also a perfect example of this model).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Supporting hardware sales</span></dt><dd><p>The value of computers and computer components is directly
     related to the amount of software available for them.  Hardware
     vendors—not just whole-machine vendors, but also makers
     of peripheral devices and microchips—have found that
     having high-quality free software to run on their hardware is
     important to customers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Undermining a competitor</span></dt><dd><p>Sometimes companies support a particular open source
     project as a means of undermining a competitor's product, which
     may or may not be open source itself.  Eating away at a
     competitor's market share is usually not the sole reason for
     getting involved with an open source project, but it can be a
     factor.</p><p>Example: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openoffice.org/">http://www.openoffice.org/</a> (no,
     this isn't the only reason OpenOffice exists, but the software is
     at least partly a response to Microsoft Office).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Marketing</span></dt><dd><p>Having your company associated with a popular open source
     application can be simply good brand management.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Dual-licensing</span></dt><dd><p><em class="firstterm">Dual-licensing</em> is the practice of
           offering software under a traditional proprietary license
           for customers who want to resell it as part of a
           proprietary application of their own, and simultaneously
           under a free license for those willing to use it under open
           source terms (see
           <a class="xref" href="ch09s06.html" title="Dual Licensing Schemes">the section called “Dual Licensing Schemes”</a><span> in
           <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Chapter 9, <em>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</em></a></span>).
           If the open source developer community is active, the
           software gets the benefits of wide-area debugging and
           development, yet the company still gets a royalty stream to
           support some full-time programmers.</p><p>Two well-known examples are <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, makers of the
           database software of the same name, and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Sleepycat</a>, which
           offers distributions and support for the Berkeley Database.
           It's no coincidence that they're both database companies.
           Database software tends to be integrated into applications
           rather than marketed directly to users, so it's very
           well-suited to the dual-licensing model.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Donations</span></dt><dd><p>A widely-used project can sometimes get significant
           contributions, from both individuals and organizations,
           just by having an online donation button, or sometimes by
           selling branded merchandise such as coffee mugs, T-shirts,
           mousepads, etc.  A word of caution: if your project accepts
           donations, plan out how the money will be used
           <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> it comes in, and state the
           plans on the project's web site.  Discussions about how to
           allocate money tend to go a lot more smoothly when held
           before there's actual money to spend; and anyway, if there
           are significant disagreements, it's better to find that out
           while it's still academic.</p></dd></dl></div><p>A funder's business model is not the only factor in how it
relates to an open source community.  The historical relationship
between the two also matters: did the company start the project, or is
it joining an existing development effort?  In both cases, the funder
will have to earn credibility, but, not surprisingly, there's a bit
more earning to be done in the latter case.  The organization needs to
have clear goals with respect to the project.  Is the company trying
to keep a position of leadership, or simply trying to be one voice in
the community, to guide but not necessarily govern the project's
direction?  Or does it just want to have a couple of committers
around, able to fix customers' bugs and get the changes into the
public distribution without any fuss?</p><p>Keep these questions in mind as you read the guidelines that
follow.  They are meant to apply to any sort of organizational
involvement in a free software project, but every project is a human
environment, and therefore no two are exactly alike.  To some degree,
you will always have to play by ear, but following these principles
will increase the likelihood of things turning out the way you
want.</p></div></div></body></html>
