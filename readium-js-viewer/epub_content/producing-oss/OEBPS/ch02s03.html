picking a license, arranging the initial web site, etc.  But the most
important aspects of starting a new project are dynamic.  Choosing a
mailing list address is easy; ensuring that the list's conversations
remain on-topic and productive is another matter entirely.  If the
project is being opened up after years of closed, in-house
development, its development processes will change, and you will have
to prepare the existing developers for that change.</p><p>The first steps are the hardest, because precedents and
expectations for future conduct have not yet been set.  Stability in a
project does not come from formal policies, but from a shared,
hard-to-pin-down collective wisdom that develops over time.  There are
often written rules as well, but they tend to be essentially a
distillation of the intangible, ever-evolving agreements that really
guide the project.  The written policies do not define the project's
culture so much as describe it, and even then only
approximately.</p><p>There are a few reasons why things work out this way.  Growth
and high turnover are not as damaging to the accumulation of social
norms as one might think.  As long as change does not happen
<span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> quickly, there is time for new arrivals to
learn how things are done, and after they learn, they will help
reinforce those ways themselves.  Consider how children's songs
survive the centuries.  There are children today singing roughly the
same rhymes as children did hundreds of years ago, even though there
are no children alive now who were alive then.  Younger children hear
the songs sung by older ones, and when they are older, they in turn
will sing them in front of other younger ones.  The children are not
engaging in a conscious program of transmission, of course, but the
reason the songs survive is nonetheless that they are transmitted
regularly and repeatedly.  The time scale of free software projects
may not be measured in centuries (we don't know yet), but the dynamics
of transmission are much the same.  The turnover rate is faster,
however, and must be compensated for by a more active and deliberate
transmission effort.</p><p>This effort is aided by the fact that people generally show up
expecting and looking for social norms.  That's just how humans are
built.  In any group unified by a common endeavor, people who join
instinctively search for behaviors that will mark them as part of the
group.  The goal of setting precedents early is to make those
"in-group" behaviors be ones that are useful to the project; for once
established, they will be largely self-perpetuating.</p><p>Following are some examples of specific things you can do to set
good precedents.  They're not meant as an exhaustive list, just as
illustrations of the idea that setting a collaborative mood early
helps a project tremendously.  Physically, every developer may be
working alone in a room by themselves, but you can do a lot to make
them <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> like they're all working together in
the same room.  The more they feel this way, the more time they'll
want to spend on the project.  I chose these particular examples
because they came up in the Subversion project (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>),
which I participated in and observed from its very beginning.  But
they're not unique to Subversion; situations like these will come up
in most open source projects, and should be seen as opportunities to
start things off on the right foot.</p><div class="sect2" title="Avoid Private Discussions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="avoid-private-discussions"/>Avoid Private Discussions</h2></div></div></div><p>Even after you've taken the project public, you and the other
founders will often find yourselves wanting to settle difficult
questions by private communications among an inner circle.  This is
especially true in the early days of the project, when there are so
many important decisions to make, and, usually, few volunteers
qualified to make them.  All the obvious disadvantages of public list
discussions will loom palpably in front of you: the delay inherent in
email conversations, the need to leave sufficient time for consensus
to form, the hassle of dealing with naive volunteers who think they
understand all the issues but actually don't (every project has these;
sometimes they're next year's star contributors, sometimes they stay
naive forever), the person who can't understand why you only want to
solve problem X when it's obviously a subset of larger problem Y, and
so on.  The temptation to make decisions behind closed doors and
present them as <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">faits accomplis</em></span>, or at
least as the firm recommendations of a united and influential voting
block, will be great indeed.</p><p>Don't do it.</p><p>As slow and cumbersome as public discussions can be, they're
almost always preferable in the long run.  Making important decisions
in private is like spraying contributor repellant on your project.  No
serious volunteer would stick around for long in an environment where
a secret council makes all the big decisions.  Furthermore, public
discussion has beneficial side effects that will last beyond whatever
ephemeral technical question was at issue:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion will help train and educate new developers.
        You never know how many eyes are watching the conversation;
        even if most people don't participate, many may be tracking
        silently, gleaning information about the software.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion will train <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> in the art
        of explaining technical issues to people who are not as
        familiar with the software as you are.  This is a skill that
        requires practice, and you can't get that practice by talking
        to people who already know what you know.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion and its conclusions will be available in public
        archives forever after, enabling future discussions to avoid
        retracing the same steps.  See
        <a class="xref" href="ch06s04.html#using-archives" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">the section called “Conspicuous Use of Archives”</a><span>
        in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>Finally, there is the possibility that someone on the list may
make a real contribution to the conversation, by coming up with an
idea you never anticipated.  It's hard to say how likely this is; it
just depends on the complexity of the code and degree of
specialization required.  But if anecdotal evidence may be permitted,
I would hazard that this is more likely than one would intuitively
expect.  In the Subversion project, we (the founders) believed we
faced a deep and complex set of problems, which we had been thinking
about hard for several months, and we frankly doubted that anyone on
the newly created mailing list was likely to make a real contribution
to the discussion.  So we took the lazy route and started batting some
technical ideas back and forth in private emails, until an observer of
the project<sup>[<a id="idp5214912" href="#ftn.idp5214912" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup> caught wind of what
was happening and asked for the discussion to be moved to the public
list.  Rolling our eyes a bit, we did—and were stunned by the
number of insightful comments and suggestions that quickly resulted.
In many cases people offered ideas that had never even occurred to us.
It turned out there were some <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> smart people
on that list; they'd just been waiting for the right bait.  It's true
that the ensuing discussions took longer than they would have if we
had kept the conversation private, but they were so much more
productive that it was well worth the extra time.</p><p>Without descending into hand-waving generalizations like "the
group is always smarter than the individual" (we've all met enough
groups to know better), it must be acknowledged that there are certain
activities at which groups excel.  Massive peer review is one of them;
generating large numbers of ideas quickly is another.  The quality of
the ideas depends on the quality of the thinking that went into them,
of course, but you won't know what kinds of thinkers are out there
until you stimulate them with a challenging problem.</p><p>Naturally, there are some discussions that must be had
privately; throughout this book we'll see examples of those.  But the
guiding principle should always be: <span class="emphasis"><em>If there's no reason for
it to be private, it should be public.</em></span></p><p>Making this happen requires action.  It's not enough merely to
ensure that all your own posts go to the public list.  You also have
to nudge other people's unnecessarily private conversations to the
list too.  If someone tries to start a private discussion, and there's
no reason for it to be private, then it is incumbent on you to open
the appropriate meta-discussion immediately.  Don't even comment on
the original topic until you've either successfully steered the
conversation to a public place, or ascertained that privacy really was
needed.  If you do this consistently, people will catch on pretty
quickly and start to use the public forums by default.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Nip Rudeness in the Bud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="prevent-rudeness"/>Nip Rudeness in the Bud</h2></div></div></div><p>From the very start of your project's public existence, you
should maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward rude or insulting
behavior in its forums.  Zero-tolerance does not mean technical
enforcement per se.  You don't have to remove people from the mailing
list when they flame another subscriber, or take away their commit
access because they made derogatory comments.  (In theory, you might
eventually have to resort to such actions, but only after all other
avenues have failed—which, by definition, isn't the case at the
start of the project.)  Zero-tolerance simply means never letting bad
behavior slide by unnoticed.  For example, when someone posts a
technical comment mixed together with an <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hominem</em></span> attack on some other developer in the project,
it is imperative that your response address the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hominem</em></span> attack <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span>, as a
separate issue unto itself, and only afterward move on to the
technical content.</p><p>It is unfortunately very easy, and all too typical, for
constructive discussions to lapse into destructive flame wars.
People will say things in email that they would never say
face-to-face.  The topics of discussion only amplify this effect: in
technical issues, people often feel there is a single right answer to
most questions, and that disagreement with that answer can only be
explained by ignorance or stupidity.  It's a short distance from
calling someone's technical proposal stupid to calling the person
themselves stupid.  In fact, it's often hard to tell where technical
debate leaves off and character attack begins, which is one reason why
drastic responses or punishments are not a good idea.  Instead, when
you think you see it happening, make a post that stresses the
importance of keeping the discussion friendly, without accusing anyone
of being deliberately poisonous.  Such "Nice Police" posts do have an
unfortunate tendency to sound like a kindergarten teacher lecturing a
class on good behavior:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>First, let's please cut down on the
      (potentially) ad hominem comments; for example, calling J's
      design for the security layer "naive and ignorant of the basic
      principles of computer security."  That may be true or it may
      not, but in either case it's no way to have the discussion.  J
      made his proposal in good faith.  If it has deficiencies, point
      them out, and we'll fix them or get a new design.  I'm sure M
      meant no personal insult to J, but the phrasing was unfortunate,
      and we try to keep things constructive around here.
      </em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Now, on to the proposal.  I think M was right
      in saying that...</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>As stilted as such responses sound, they have a noticeable
effect.  If you consistently call out bad behavior, but don't demand
an apology or acknowledgment from the offending party, then you leave
people free to cool down and show their better side by behaving more
decorously next time—and they will.  One of the secrets of
doing this successfully is to never make the meta-discussion the main
topic.  It should always be an aside, a brief preface to the main
portion of your response.  Point out in passing that "we don't do
things that way around here," but then move on to the real content, so
that you're giving people something on-topic to respond to.  If
someone protests that they didn't deserve your rebuke, simply refuse
to be drawn into an argument about it.  Either don't respond (if you
think they're just letting off steam and don't require a response), or
say you're sorry if you overreacted and that it's hard to detect
nuance in email, then get back to the main topic.  Never, ever insist
on an acknowledgment, whether public or private, from someone that
they behaved inappropriately.  If they choose of their own volition to
post an apology, that's great, but demanding that they do so will only
cause resentment.</p><p>The overall goal is to make good etiquette be seen as one of the
"in-group" behaviors.  This helps the project, because developers can
be driven away (even from projects they like and want to support) by
flame wars.  You may not even know that they were driven away; someone
might lurk on the mailing list, see that it takes a thick skin to
participate in the project, and decide against getting involved at
all.  Keeping forums friendly is a long-term survival strategy, and
it's easier to do when the project is still small.  Once it's part of
the culture, you won't have to be the only person promoting it.  It
will be maintained by everyone.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="code-review"/>Practice Conspicuous Code Review</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the best ways to foster a productive development
community is to get people looking at each others' code.  Some
technical infrastructure is required to do this effectively—in
particular, commit emails must be turned on; see
<a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#commit-emails" title="Commit emails">the section called “Commit emails”</a> for more details.  The effect of
commit emails is that every time someone commits a change to the
source code, an email goes out showing the log message and diffs for
the change (see <a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#vc-vocabulary-diff"><em class="firstterm">diff</em></a>, in
<a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#vc-vocabulary" title="Version Control Vocabulary">the section called “Version Control Vocabulary”</a>).  <em class="firstterm">Code review</em>
is the practice of reviewing commit emails as they come in, looking
for bugs and possible improvements.<sup>[<a id="idp5233904" href="#ftn.idp5233904" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup></p><p>Code review serves several purposes simultaneously.  It's the
most obvious example of peer review in the open source world, and
directly helps to maintain software quality.  Every bug that ships in
a piece of software got there by being committed and not detected;
therefore, the more eyes watch commits, the fewer bugs will ship.  But
code review also serves an indirect purpose: it confirms to people
that what they do matters, because one obviously wouldn't take time to
review a commit unless one cared about its effect.  People do their
best work when they know that others will take the time to evaluate
it.</p><p>Reviews should be public.  Even on occasions when I have been
sitting in the same physical room with developers, and one of us has
made a commit, we take care not to do the review verbally in the room,
but to send it to the development mailing list instead.  Everyone
benefits from seeing the review happen.  People follow the commentary
and sometimes find flaws in it, and even when they don't, it still
reminds them that review is an expected, regular activity, like
washing the dishes or mowing the lawn.</p><p>In the Subversion project, we did not at first make a regular
practice of code review.  There was no guarantee that every commit
would be reviewed, though one might sometimes look over a change if
one was particularly interested in that area of the code.  Bugs
slipped in that really could and should have been caught.  A developer
named Greg Stein, who knew the value of code review from past work,
decided that he was going to set an example by reviewing every line of
<span class="emphasis"><em>every single commit</em></span> that went into the code
repository.  Each commit anyone made was soon followed by an email to
the developer's list from Greg, dissecting the commit, analyzing
possible problems, and occasionally praising a clever bit of code.  Right
away, he was catching bugs and non-optimal coding practices that would
otherwise have slipped by without ever being noticed.  Pointedly, he
never complained about being the only person reviewing every commit,
even though it took a fair amount of his time, but he did sing the
praises of code review whenever he had the chance.  Pretty soon, other
people, myself included, started reviewing commits regularly too.
What was our motivation?  It wasn't that Greg had consciously shamed
us into it.  But he had proven that reviewing code was a valuable way
to spend time, and that one could contribute as much to the project by
reviewing others' changes as by writing new code.  Once he
demonstrated that, it became expected behavior, to the point where any
commit that didn't get some reaction would cause the committer to
worry, and even ask on the list whether anyone had had a chance to
review it yet.  Later, Greg got a job that didn't leave him as much
time for Subversion, and had to stop doing regular reviews.  But by
then, the habit was so ingrained for the rest of us as to seem that it
had been going on since time immemorial.</p><p>Start doing reviews from very first commit.  The sorts of
problems that are easiest to catch by reviewing diffs are security
vulnerabilities, memory leaks, insufficient comments or API
documentation, off-by-one errors, caller/callee discipline mismatches,
and other problems that require a minimum of surrounding context to
spot.  However, even larger-scale issues such as failure to abstract
repeated patterns to a single location become spottable after one has
been doing reviews regularly, because the memory of past diffs informs
the review of present diffs.</p><p>Don't worry that you might not find anything to comment on, or
that you don't know enough about every area of the code.  There will
usually be something to say about almost every commit; even where you
don't find anything to question, you may find something to praise.
The important thing is to make it clear to every committer that what
they do is seen and understood.  Of course, code review does not
absolve programmers of the responsibility to review and test their
changes before committing; no one should depend on code review to
catch things he ought to have caught on his own.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="When Opening a Formerly Closed Project, be Sensitive to the Magnitude of the Change"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="opening-closed-projects"/>When Opening a Formerly Closed Project, be Sensitive to the
Magnitude of the Change</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're opening up an existing project, one that already has
active developers accustomed to working in a closed-source
environment, make sure everyone understands that a big change is
coming—and make sure that you understand how it's going to
feel from their point of view.</p><p>Try to imagine how the situation looks to them: formerly, all
code and design decisions were made with a group of other programmers
who knew the software more or less equally well, who all received the
same pressures from the same management, and who all know each others'
strengths and weaknesses.  Now you're asking them to expose their code
to the scrutiny of random strangers, who will form judgements based
only on the code, with no awareness of what business pressures may
have forced certain decisions.  These strangers will ask lots of
questions, questions that jolt the existing developers into realizing
that the documentation they slaved so hard over is
<span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> inadequate (this is inevitable).  To top it
all off, the newcomers are unknown, faceless entities.  If one of your
developers already feels insecure about his skills, imagine how that
will be exacerbated when newcomers point out flaws in code he wrote,
and worse, do so in front of his colleagues.  Unless you have a team
of perfect coders, this is unavoidable—in fact, it will probably
happen to all of them at first.  This is not because they're bad
programmers; it's just that any program above a certain size has bugs,
and peer review will spot some of those bugs (see
<a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the section called “Practice Conspicuous Code Review”</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>).  At the same time, the newcomers
themselves won't be subject to much peer review at first, since they
can't contribute code until they're more familiar with the project.
To your developers, it may feel like all the criticism is incoming,
never outgoing.  Thus, there is the danger of a siege mentality taking
hold among the old hands.</p><p>The best way to prevent this is to warn everyone about what's
coming, explain it, tell them that the initial discomfort is perfectly
normal, and reassure them that it's going to get better.  Some of
these warnings should take place privately, before the project is
opened.  But you may also find it helpful to remind people on the
public lists that this is a new way of development for the project,
and that it will take some time to adjust.  The very best thing you
can do is lead by example.  If you don't see your developers answering
enough newbie questions, then just telling them to answer more isn't
going to help.  They may not have a good sense of what warrants a
response and what doesn't yet, or it could be that they don't have a
feel for how to prioritize coding work against the new burden of
external communications.  The way to get them to participate is to
participate yourself.  Be on the public mailing lists, and make sure
to answer some questions there.  When you don't have the
expertise to field a question, then visibly hand it off to a developer
who does—and watch to make sure he follows up with an answer,
or at least a response.  It will naturally be tempting for the
longtime developers to lapse into private discussions, since that's
what they're used to.  Make sure you're subscribed to the internal
mailing lists on which this might happen, so you can ask that such
discussions be moved to the public lists right away.</p><p>There are other, longer-term concerns with opening up formerly
