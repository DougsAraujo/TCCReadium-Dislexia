parallel.  For example, after 1.0.0 comes out, that line should
continue with micro (bugfix) releases 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc., until the
project explicitly decides to end the line.  Note that merely
releasing 1.1.0 is not sufficient reason to end the 1.0.x line.  For
example, some users make it a policy never to upgrade to the first
release in a new minor or major series—they let others shake the
bugs out of, say 1.1.0, and wait until 1.1.1.  This isn't necessarily
selfish (remember, they're forgoing the bugfixes and new features
too); it's just that, for whatever reason, they've decided to be very
careful with upgrades.  Accordingly, if the project learns of a major
bug in 1.0.3 right before it's about to release 1.1.0, it would be a
bit severe to just put the bugfix in 1.1.0 and tell all the old 1.0.x
users they should upgrade.  Why not release both 1.1.0 and 1.0.4, so
everyone can be happy?</p><p>After the 1.1.x line is well under way, you can declare 1.0.x to
be at <em class="firstterm">end of life</em>.  This should be announced
officially.  The announcement could stand alone, or it could be
mentioned as part of a 1.1.x release announcement; however you do
it, users need to know that the old line is being phased out, so they
can make upgrade decisions accordingly.</p><p>Some projects set a window of time during which they pledge to
support the previous release line.  In an open source context,
"support" means accepting bug reports against that line, and making
maintenance releases when significant bugs are found.  Other projects
don't give a definite amount of time, but watch incoming bug reports
to gauge how many people are still using the older line.  When the
percentage drops below a certain point, they declare end of life for
the line and stop supporting it.</p><p>For each release, make sure to have a <em class="firstterm">target
version</em> or <em class="firstterm">target milestone</em>
available in the bug tracker, so people filing bugs will be able to do
so against the proper release.  Don't forget to also have a target
called "development" or "latest" for the most recent development
sources, since some people—not only active developers—will
often stay ahead of the official releases.</p><div class="sect2" title="Security Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="security-releases"/>Security Releases</h2></div></div></div><p>Most of the details of handling security bugs were covered in
<a class="xref" href="ch06s06.html#security" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">the section called “Announcing Security Vulnerabilities”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span>, but there are some
special details to discuss for doing security releases.</p><p>A <em class="firstterm">security release</em> is a release made
solely to close a security vulnerability.  The code that fixes the bug
cannot be made public until the release is available, which means not
only that the fixes cannot be committed to the repository until the
day of the release, but also that the release cannot be publicly
tested before it goes out the door.  Obviously, the developers can
examine the fix among themselves, and test the release privately, but
widespread real-world testing is not possible.</p><p>Because of this lack of testing, a security release should
always consist of some existing release plus the fixes for the
security bug, with <span class="emphasis"><em>no other changes</em></span>.  This is
because the more changes you ship without testing, the more likely
that one of them will cause a new bug, perhaps even a new security
bug!  This conservatism is also friendly to administrators who may
need to deploy the security fix, but whose upgrade policy prefers that
they not deploy any other changes at the same time.</p><p>Making a security release sometimes involves some minor
deception.  For example, the project may have been working on a 1.1.3
release, with certain bug fixes to 1.1.2 already publicly declared,
when a security report comes in.  Naturally, the developers cannot
talk about the security problem until they make the fix available;
until then, they must continue to talk publicly as though 1.1.3 will
be what it's always been planned to be.  But when 1.1.3 actually
comes out, it will differ from 1.1.2 only in the security fixes, and
all those other fixes will have been deferred to 1.1.4 (which, of
course, will now <span class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> contain the security
fix, as will all other future releases).</p><p>You could add an extra component to an existing release to
indicate that it contains security changes only.  For example, people
would be able to tell just from the numbers that 1.1.2.1 is a security
release against 1.1.2, and they would know that any release "higher"
than that (e.g., 1.1.3, 1.2.0, etc.) contains the same security fixes.
For those in the know, this system conveys a lot of information.  On
the other hand, for those not following the project closely, it can be
a bit confusing to see a three-component release number most of the
time with an occasional four-component one thrown in seemingly at
random.  Most projects I've looked at choose consistency and simply
use the next regularly scheduled number for security releases, even
when it means shifting other planned releases by one.</p></div></div></body></html>
