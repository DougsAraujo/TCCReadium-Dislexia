in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter 4, <em>Social and Political Infrastructure</em></a></span>, we saw how
the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span> to fork has important effects on
how projects are governed.  But what happens when a fork actually
occurs?  How should you handle it, and what effects can you expect it
to have?  Conversely, when should you <span class="emphasis"><em>initiate</em></span> a
fork?</p><p>The answers depend on what kind of fork it is.  Some forks are
due to amicable but irreconcilable disagreements about the direction
of the project; perhaps more are due to both technical disagreements
and interpersonal conflicts.  Of course, it's not always possible to
tell the difference between the two, as technical arguments may
involve personal elements as well.  What all forks have in common is
that one group of developers (or sometimes even just one developer)
has decided that the costs of working with some or all of the others
now outweigh the benefits.</p><p>Once a project forks, there is no definitive answer to the
question of which fork is the "true" or "original" project.  People
will colloquially talk of fork F coming out of project P, as though P
is continuing unchanged down some natural path while F diverges into
new territory, but this is, in effect, a declaration of how that
particular observer feels about it.  It is fundamentally a matter of
perception: when a large enough percentage of observers agree, the
assertion starts to become true.  It is not the case that there is an
objective truth from the outset, one that we are only imperfectly able to
perceive at first.  Rather, the perceptions <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
the objective truth, since ultimately a project—or a
fork—is an entity that exists only in people's minds
anyway.</p><p>If those initiating the fork feel that they are
sprouting a new branch off the main project, the perception question
is resolved immediately and easily.  Everyone, both developers and
users, will treat the fork as a new project, with a new name (perhaps
based on the old name, but easily distinguishable from it), a separate
web site, and a separate philosophy or goal.  Things get messier,
however, when both sides feel they are the legitimate guardians of the
original project and therefore have the right to continue using the
original name.  If there is some organization with trademark rights to
the name, or legal control over the domain or web pages, that usually
resolves the issue by fiat: that organization will decide who is the
project and who is the fork, because it holds all the cards in a
public relations war.  Naturally, things rarely get that far: since
everyone already knows what the power dynamics are, they will avoid
fighting a battle whose outcome is known in advance, and just jump
straight to the end.</p><p>Fortunately, in most cases there is little doubt as to which is
the project and which is the fork, because a fork is, in essence, a vote
of confidence.  If more than half of the developers are in favor of
whatever course the fork proposes to take, usually there is no need to
fork—the project can simply go that way itself, unless it is run
as a dictatorship with a particularly stubborn dictator.  On the other
hand, if fewer than half of the developers are in favor, the fork is a
clearly minority rebellion, and both courtesy and common sense
indicate that it should think of itself as the divergent branch rather
than the main line.</p><div class="sect2" title="Handling a Fork"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="forks-handling"/>Handling a Fork</h2></div></div></div><p>If someone threatens a fork in your project, keep calm and
remember your long-term goals.  The mere
<span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a fork isn't what hurts a project;
rather, it's the loss of developers and users.  Your real aim,
therefore, is not to squelch the fork, but to minimize these harmful
effects.  You may be mad, you may feel that the fork was unjust and
uncalled for, but expressing that publicly can only alienate undecided
developers.  Instead, don't force people to make exclusive choices,
and be as cooperative as is practicable with the fork.  To start with,
don't remove someone's commit access in your project just because he
decided to work on the fork.  Work on the fork doesn't mean that
person has suddenly lost his competence to work on the original
project; committers before should remain committers afterward.  Beyond
that, you should express your desire to remain as compatible as
possible with the fork, and say that you hope developers will port
changes between the two whenever appropriate.  If you have
administrative access to the project's servers, publicly offer the
forkers infrastructure help at startup time.  For example, offer them
a complete, deep-history copy of the version control repository, if
there's no other way for them to get it, so that they don't have to
start off without historical data (this may not be necessary depending
on the version control system).  Ask them if there's anything else
they need, and provide it if you can.  Bend over backward to show
that you are not standing in the way, and that you want the fork to
succeed or fail on its own merits and nothing else.</p><p>The reason to do all this—and do it publicly—is not
to actually help the fork, but to persuade developers that your side
is a safe bet, by appearing as non-vindictive as possible.  In war it
sometimes makes sense (strategic sense, if not human sense) to force
people to choose sides, but in free software it almost never does.  In
fact, after a fork some developers often openly work on both projects,
and do their best to keep the two compatible.  These developers help
keep the lines of communication open after the fork.  They allow your
project to benefit from interesting new features in the fork (yes, the
fork may have things you want), and also increase the chances of a
merger down the road.</p><p>Sometimes a fork becomes so successful that, even though it was
regarded even by its own instigators as a fork at the outset, it
becomes the version everybody prefers, and eventually supplants the
original by popular demand.  A famous instance of this was the
GCC/EGCS fork.  The <em class="firstterm">GNU Compiler Collection</em>
(<em class="firstterm">GCC</em>, formerly the <em class="firstterm">GNU C
Compiler</em>) is the most popular open source native-code
compiler, and also one of the 
most portable compilers in the world.  Due to disagreements between the GCC's
official maintainers and Cygnus Software,<sup>[<a id="idp8427568" href="#ftn.idp8427568" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup> one
of GCC's most active developer groups, Cygnus created a fork of GCC
called <em class="firstterm">EGCS</em>.  The fork was deliberately
non-adversarial: the EGCS developers did not, at any point, try to
portray their version of GCC as a new official version.  Instead, they
concentrated on making EGCS as good as possible, incorporating patches
at a faster rate than the official GCC maintainers.  EGCS gained in
popularity, and eventually some major operating system distributors
decided to package EGCS as their default compiler instead of GCC.  At
this point, it became clear to the GCC maintainers that holding on to
the "GCC" name while everyone switched to the EGCS fork would burden
everyone with a needless name change, yet do nothing to prevent the
switchover.  So GCC adopted the EGCS codebase, and there is once again
a single GCC, but greatly improved because of the fork.</p><p>This example shows why you cannot always regard a fork as an
unadulteratedly bad thing.  A fork may be painful and unwelcome at the
time, but you cannot necessarily know whether it will succeed.
Therefore, you and the rest of the project should keep an eye on it,
and be prepared not only to absorb features and code where possible,
but in the most extreme case to even join the fork if it gains the
bulk of the project's mindshare.  Of course, you will often be able to
predict a fork's likelihood of success by seeing who joins it.  If the
fork is started by the project's biggest complainer and joined by a
handful of disgruntled developers who weren't behaving constructively
anyway, they've essentially solved a problem for you by forking, and
you probably don't need to worry about the fork taking momentum away
from the original project.  But if you see influential and respected
developers supporting the fork, you should ask yourself why.  Perhaps
the project was being overly restrictive, and the best solution is to
adopt into the mainline project some or all of the actions
contemplated by the fork—in essence, to avoid the fork by
becoming it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Initiating a Fork"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="forks-initiating"/>Initiating a Fork</h2></div></div></div><p>All the advice here assumes that you are forking as a last
resort.  Exhaust all other possibilities before starting a fork.
Forking almost always means losing developers, with only an uncertain
promise of gaining new ones later.  It also means starting out with
competition for users' attention: everyone who's about to download the
software has to ask themselves: "Hmm, do I want that one or the other
one?"  Whichever one you are, the situation is messy, because a
question has been introduced that wasn't there before.  Some people
maintain that forks are healthy for the software ecosystem as a whole,
by a standard natural selection argument: the fittest will survive,
which means that, in the end, everyone gets better software.  This may
be true from the ecosystem's point of view, but it's not true from the
point of view of any individual project.  Most forks do not succeed,
and most projects are not happy to be forked.</p><p>A corollary is that you should not use the threat of a fork as
an extremist debating technique—"Do things my way or I'll fork
the project!"—because everyone is aware that a fork that fails
to attract developers away from the original project is unlikely to
survive long.  All observers—not just developers, but users and
operating system packagers too—will make their own judgement about
which side to choose.  You should therefore appear extremely reluctant
to fork, so that if you finally do it, you can credibly claim it was
the only route left.</p><p>Do not neglect to take <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> factors into
account in evaluating the potential success of your fork.  For
example, if many of the developers on a project have the same
employer, then even if they are disgruntled and privately in favor of
a fork, they are unlikely to say so out loud if they know that their
employer is against it.  Many free software programmers like to think
that having a free license on the code means no one company can
dominate development.  It is true that the license is, in an ultimate
sense, a guarantor of freedom—if others want badly enough to
fork the project, and have the resources to do so, they can.  But in
practice, some projects' development teams are mostly funded by one
entity, and there is no point pretending that the entity's support
doesn't matter.  If it is opposed to the fork, its developers are
unlikely to take part, even if they secretly want to.</p><p>If you still conclude that you must fork, line up support
privately first, then announce the fork in a non-hostile tone.  Even
if you are angry at, or disappointed with, the current maintainers,
don't say that in the message.  Just dispassionately state what led
you to the decision to fork, and that you mean no ill will toward the
project from which you're forking.  Assuming that you do consider it a
fork (as opposed to an emergency preservation of the original
project), emphasize that you're forking the code and not the name, and
choose a name that does not conflict with the project's name.  You can
use a name that contains or refers to the original name, as long as it
does not open the door to identity confusion.  Of course it's fine to
explain prominently on the fork's home page that it descends from the
original program, and even that it hopes to supplant it.  Just don't
make users' lives harder by forcing them to untangle an identity
dispute.</p><p>Finally, you can get things started on the right foot by
automatically granting all committers of the original project commit
access to the fork, including even those who openly disagreed with the
need for a fork.  Even if they never use the access, your message is
clear: there are disagreements here, but no enemies, and you welcome
code contributions from any competent source.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp8427568" href="#idp8427568" class="para">29</a>] </sup>Now part of
