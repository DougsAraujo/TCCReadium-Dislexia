Whatever people may say about their motivations for participating in a
project, I don't know any developers who would be happy doing all
their work anonymously, or under someone else's name.  There are
tangible reasons for this: one's reputation in a project roughly
governs how much influence one has, and participation in an open
source project can also indirectly have monetary value, because
some employers now look for it on resumés.  There are also
intangible reasons, perhaps even more powerful: people simply want to
be appreciated, and instinctively look for signs that their work was
recognized by others.  The promise of credit is therefore one of best
motivators the project has.  When small contributions are
acknowledged, people come back to do more.</p><p>One of the most important features of collaborative development
software (see <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Technical Infrastructure">Chapter 3, <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a>) is that
it keeps accurate records of who did what, when.  Wherever possible,
use these existing mechanisms to make sure that credit is distributed
accurately, and be specific about the nature of the contribution.
Don't just write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;" if
instead you can write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;
for the bug report and reproduction recipe" in a log message.</p><p>In Subversion, we have an informal but consistent policy of
crediting the reporter of a bug in either the issue filed, if there is
one, or the log message of the commit that fixes the bug, if not.  A
quick survey of Subversion commit logs up to commit number 14525 shows
that about 10% of commits give credit to someone by name and email
address, usually the person who reported or analyzed the bug fixed by
that commit.  Note that this person is different from the developer
who actually made the commit, whose name is already recorded
automatically by the version control system.  Of the 80-odd full and
partial committers Subversion has today, 55 were credited in the
commit logs (usually multiple times) before they became committers
themselves.  This does not, of course, prove that being credited was a
factor in their continued involvement, but it at least sets up an
atmosphere in which people know they can count on their contributions
being acknowledged.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between routine acknowledgment
and special thanks.  When discussing a particular piece of code, or
some other contribution someone made, it is fine to acknowledge their
work.  For example, saying "Daniel's recent changes to the delta code
mean we can now implement feature X" simultaneously helps people
identify which changes you're talking about and acknowledges Daniel's
work.  On the other hand, posting solely to thank Daniel for the delta
code changes serves no immediate practical purpose.  It doesn't add
any information, since the version control system and other mechanisms
have already recorded the fact that he made the changes.  Thanking
everyone for everything would be distracting and ultimately
information-free, since thanks are effective largely by how much they
stand out from the default, background level of favorable comment
going on all the time.  This does not mean, of course, that you should
never thank people.  Just make sure to do it in ways that tend not to
lead to credit inflation.  Following these guidelines will
help:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The more ephemeral the forum, the more free you
            should feel to express thanks there.  For example,
            thanking someone for their bugfix in passing during an IRC
            conversation is fine, as is an aside in an email devoted
            mainly to other topics.  But don't post an email solely to
            thank someone, unless it's for a truly unusual feat.
            Likewise, don't clutter the project's web pages with
            expressions of gratitude.  Once you start that, it'll
            never be clear when or where to stop. And
            <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> put thanks into comments in the
            code; that would only be a distraction from the primary
            purpose of comments, which is to help the reader
            understand the code.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The less involved someone is in the project, the
            more appropriate it is to thank her for something she
            did.  This may sound counterintuitive, but it fits with
            the attitude that expressing thanks is something you do
            when someone contributes even more than you thought she
            would.  Thus, to constantly thank regular contributors for
            doing what they normally do would be to express a lower
            expectation of them than they have of themselves.  If
            anything, you want to aim for the opposite effect!</p><p>There are occasional exceptions to this rule.  It's
            acceptable to thank someone for fulfilling his expected
            role when that role involves temporary, intense efforts
            from time to time.  The canonical example is the release
            manager, who goes into high gear around the time of each
            release, but otherwise lies dormant (dormant as a release
            manager, in any case—he may also be an active
            developer, but that's a different matter).
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As with criticism and crediting, gratitude should
            be specific.  Don't thank people just for being great,
            even if they are.  Thank them for something they did that
            was out of the ordinary, and for bonus points, say
            exactly why what they did was so great.</p></li></ul></div><p>In general, there is always a tension between making sure that
people's individual contributions are recognized, and making sure the
project is a group effort rather than a collection of individual
glories.  Just remain aware of this tension and try to err on the
side of group, and things won't get out of hand.</p></div></body></html>
