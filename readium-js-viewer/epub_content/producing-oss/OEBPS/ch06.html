one can have in an open source environment.  In the long run it
matters more than programming talent.  A great programmer with lousy
communications skills can get only one thing done at a time, and even
then may have trouble convincing others to pay attention.  But a lousy
programmer with good communications skills can coordinate and persuade
many people to do many different things, and thereby have a
significant effect on a project's direction and momentum.</p><p>There does not seem to be much correlation, in either direction,
between the ability to write good code and the ability to communicate
with one's fellow human beings.  There is some correlation between
programming well and describing technical issues well, but describing
technical issues is only a tiny part of the communications in a
project.  Much more important is the ability to empathize with one's
audience, to see one's own posts and comments as others see them, and
to cause others to see their own posts with similar objectivity.
Equally important is noticing when a given medium or communications
method is no longer working well, perhaps because it doesn't scale as
the number of users increases, and taking the time to do something
about it.</p><p>All of which is obvious in theory—what makes it hard in
practice is that free software development environments are
bewilderingly diverse both in audiences and in communications
mechanisms.  Should a given thought be expressed in a post to the
mailing list, as an annotation in the bug tracker, or as a comment
in the code?  When answering a question in a public forum, how much
knowledge can you assume on the part of the reader, given that "the
reader" is not only the one who asked the question in the first place,
but all those who might see your response?  How can the developers
stay in constructive contact with the users, without getting swamped
by feature requests, spurious bug reports, and general chatter?  How
do you tell when a medium has reached the limits of its capacity, and
what do you do about it?</p><p>Solutions to these problems are usually partial, because any
particular solution is eventually made obsolete by project growth or
changes in project structure.  They are also often <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hoc</em></span>, because they're improvised responses to dynamic
situations.  All participants need to be aware of when and how
communications can become bogged down, and be involved in
solutions.  Helping people do this is a big part of managing an open
source project.  The sections that follow discuss both how to conduct
your own communications, and how to make maintenance of communications
mechanisms a priority for everyone in the project.<sup>[<a id="idp6928384" href="#ftn.idp6928384" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect1" title="You Are What You Write"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="you-are-what-you-write"/>You Are What You Write</h1></div></div></div><p>Consider this: the only thing anyone knows about you on the
Internet comes from what you write, or what others write about you.
You may be brilliant, perceptive, and charismatic in person—but
if your emails are rambling and unstructured, people will assume
that's the real you.  Or perhaps you really are rambling and
unstructured in person, but no one need ever know it, if your posts
are lucid and informative.</p><p>Devoting some care to your writing will pay off hugely.
Long-time free software hacker Jim Blandy tells the following
story:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Back in 1993, I was working for the Free Software Foundation,
  and we were beta-testing version 19 of GNU Emacs.  We'd make a beta
  release every week or so, and people would try it out and send us
  bug reports.  There was this one guy whom none of us had met in
  person but who did great work: his bug reports were always clear and
  led us straight to the problem, and when he provided a fix himself,
  it was almost always right.  He was top-notch.</p><p>Now, before the FSF can use code written by someone else, we
  have them do some legal paperwork to assign their copyright interest
  to that code to the FSF.  Just taking code from complete strangers
  and dropping it in is a recipe for legal disaster.</p><p>So I emailed the guy the forms, saying, "Here's some paperwork
  we need, here's what it means, you sign this one, have your employer
  sign that one, and then we can start putting in your fixes.  Thanks
  very much."</p><p>He sent me back a message saying, "I don't have an
  employer."</p><p>So I said, "Okay, that's fine, just have your university sign
  it and send it back."</p><p>After a bit, he wrote me back again, and said, "Well,
  actually...  I'm thirteen years old and I live with my
  parents."</p></blockquote></div><p>Because that kid didn't write like a thirteen-year-old, no one
knew that's what he was.  Following are some ways to make your writing
give a good impression too.</p><div class="sect2" title="Structure and Formatting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="structure-and-formatting"/>Structure and Formatting</h2></div></div></div><p>Don't fall into the trap of writing everything as though it were
a cell phone text message.  Write in complete sentences, capitalizing
the first word of each sentence, and use paragraph breaks where
needed.  This is most important in emails and other composed writings.
In IRC or similarly ephemeral forums, it's generally okay to leave out
capitalization, use compressed forms of common expressions, etc.  Just
don't carry those habits over into more formal, persistent forums.
Emails, documentation, bug reports, and other pieces of writing that
are intended to have a permanent life should be written using standard
grammar and spelling, and have a coherent narrative structure.  This
is not because there's anything inherently good about following
arbitrary rules, but rather that these rules are
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> arbitrary: they evolved into their present
forms because they make text more readable, and you should adhere to
them for that reason.  Readability is desirable not only because it
means more people will understand what you write, but because it makes
you look like the sort of person who takes the time to communicate
clearly: that is, someone worth paying attention to.</p><p>For email in particular, experienced open source developers have
settled on certain conventions:</p><p>Send plain text mails only, not HTML, RichText, or other formats
that might be opaque to text-only mail readers.  Format your lines to
be around 72 columns long.  Don't exceed 80 columns, which has become
the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> standard terminal width
(that is, some people may use wider terminals, but no one uses a
narrower one).  By making your lines a little
<span class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> than 80 columns, you leave room for a few
levels of quoting characters to be added in others' replies without
forcing a rewrapping of your text.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Use real line breaks.</em></span> Some mailers do a
kind of fake line wrapping, whereby when you're composing an email,
the display shows line breaks that aren't actually there.  When the
mail goes out, it may not have the line breaks you thought it had, and
it will wrap awkwardly on some people's screens.  If your mailer might
use fake line breaks, look for a setting you can tweak to make it show
the true line breaks as you compose.</p><p>When including screen output, snippets of code, or other
preformatted text, offset it clearly, so that even a lazy eye can
easily see the boundaries between your prose and the material you're
quoting.  (I never expected to write that advice when I started this
book, but on a number of open source mailing lists lately, I've seen
people mix texts from different sources without making it clear which
is which.  The effect is very frustrating.  It makes their posts
significantly harder to understand, and frankly makes those people
look a little bit disorganized.)</p><p>When quoting someone else's mail, insert your responses where
they're most appropriate, at several different places if necessary,
and trim off the parts of their mail you didn't use.  If you're
writing a quick comment that applies to their entire post, it's okay
to <em class="firstterm">top-post</em> (that is, to put your response
above the quoted text of their mail); otherwise, you should quote
the relevant portion of the original text first, followed by your
response.</p><p>Construct the subject lines of new mails carefully.  It's the
most important line in your mail, because it allows each other person
in the project to decide whether or not to read more.  Modern
mail reading software organizes groups of related messages into
threads, which can be defined not only by a common subject, but by
various other headers (which are sometimes not displayed).  It follows
that if a thread starts to drift to a new topic, you can—and
should—adjust the subject line accordingly when replying.  The
thread's integrity will be preserved, due to those other headers, but
the new subject will help people looking at an overview of the thread
know that the topic has drifted.  Likewise, if you really want to
start a new topic, do it by posting a fresh mail, not by replying to
an existing mail and changing the subject.  Otherwise, your mail would
still be grouped in to the same thread as what you're replying to, and
thus fool people into thinking it's about something it's not.  Again,
the penalty would not only be the waste of their time, but the slight
dent in your credibility as someone fluent in using communications
tools.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Content"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="writing-content"/>Content</h2></div></div></div><p>Well-formatted mails attract readers, but content keeps them.
No set of fixed rules can guarantee good content, of course, but there
are some principles that make it more likely.</p><p>Make things easy for your readers.  There's a ton of information
floating around in any active open source project, and readers cannot
be expected to be familiar with most of it—indeed, they cannot
always be expected to know how to become familiar.  Wherever possible,
your posts should provide information in the form most convenient for
readers.  If you have to spend an extra two minutes to dig up the URL
to a particular thread in the mailing list archives, in order to save
your readers the trouble of doing so, it's worth it.  If you have to
spend an extra 5 or 10 minutes summarizing the conclusions so far
of a complex thread, in order to give people context in which to
understand your post, then do so.  Think of it this way: the more
successful a project, the higher the reader-to-writer ratio in any
given forum.  If every post you make is seen by <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>
people, then as <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> rises, the worthwhileness of
expending extra effort to save those people time rises with it.  And
as people see you imposing this standard on yourself, they will work
to match it in their own communications.  The result is, ideally, an
increase in the global efficiency of the project: when there is a
choice between <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> people making an effort and one
person doing so, the project prefers the latter.</p><p>Don't engage in hyperbole.  Exaggerating in online posts is a
classic arms race.  For example, a person reporting a bug may worry
that the developers will not pay sufficient attention, so he'll
describe it as a severe, showstopper problem that is preventing him
(and all his friends/coworkers/cousins) from using the software
productively, when it's actually only a mild annoyance.  But
exaggeration is not limited to users—programmers often do the
same thing during technical debates, particularly when the
disagreement is over a matter of taste rather than correctness:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"Doing it that way would make the code totally
     unreadable.  It'd be a maintenance nightmare, compared to
     J. Random's proposal..."</p></blockquote></div><p>The same sentiment actually becomes
<span class="emphasis"><em>stronger</em></span> when phrased less sharply:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"That works, but it's less than ideal in terms of
     readability and maintainability, I think.  J. Random's proposal
     avoids those problems because it..."</p></blockquote></div><p>You will not be able to get rid of hyperbole completely, and in
general it's not necessary to do so.  Compared to other forms of
miscommunication, hyperbole is not globally damaging—it hurts
mainly the perpetrator.  The recipients can compensate, it's just that
the sender loses a little more credibility each time.  Therefore, for
the sake of your own influence in the project, try to err on the side
of moderation.  That way, when you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> need to
make a strong point, people will take you seriously.</p><p>Edit twice.  For any message longer than a medium-sized
paragraph, reread it from top to bottom before sending it but after
you think it's done the first time.  This is familiar advice to anyone
who's taken a composition class, but it's especially important in
online discussion.  Because the process of online composition tends to
be highly discontinuous (in the course of writing a message, you may
need to go back and check other mails, visit certain web pages, run a
command to capture its debugging output, etc.), it's especially easy to
lose your sense of narrative place.  Messages that were composed
discontinuously and not checked before being sent are often
recognizable as such, much to the chagrin (or so one would hope) of
their authors.  Take the time to review what you send.  The more your
posts hold together structurally, the more they will be read.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Tone"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="writing-tone"/>Tone</h2></div></div></div><p>After writing thousands of messages, you will probably find your
style tending toward the terse.  This seems to be the norm in most
technical forums, and there's nothing wrong with it per se.  A degree
of terseness that would be unacceptable in normal social interactions
is simply the default for free software hackers.  Here's a response I
once drew on a mailing list about some free content management
software, quoted in full:</p><pre class="screen">
Can you possibly elaborate a bit more on exactly what problems
you ran into, etc?

Also:

What version of Slash are you using? I couldn't tell from your
original message.

Exactly how did you build the apache/mod_perl source?

Did you try the Apache 2.0 patch that was posted about on
slashcode.com?

  Shane
</pre><p>Now <span class="emphasis"><em>that's</em></span> terse!  No greeting, no sign-off
other than his name, and the message itself is just a series of
questions phrased as compactly as possible.  His one declarative
sentence was an implicit criticism of my original message.  And yet, I
was happy to see Shane's mail, and didn't take his terseness as a sign
of anything other than him being a busy person.  The mere fact that he
was asking questions, instead of ignoring my post, meant that he was
willing to spend some time on my problem.</p><p>Will all readers react positively to this style?  Not
necessarily; it depends on the person and the context.  For example,
if someone has just posted acknowledging that she made a mistake
(perhaps she wrote a bug), and you know from past experience that
this person tends to be a bit insecure, then while you may still write
a compact response, you should make sure to leaven it with some sort
of acknowledgment of her feelings.  The bulk of your response might
be a brief, engineer's-eye analysis of the situation, as terse as you
want.  But at the end, sign off with something indicating that your
terseness is not to be taken as coldness.  For example, if you've just
given reams of advice about exactly how the person should fix the bug,
then sign off with "Good luck, &lt;your name here&gt;" to indicate
that you wish them well and are not mad.  A strategically placed
smiley face or other emoticlue can often be enough to reassure an
interlocutor, too.</p><p>It may seem odd to focus as much on the participant's feelings
as on the surface of what they say, but to put it baldly, feelings
affect productivity.  Feelings are important for other reasons too,
but even confining ourselves to purely utilitarian grounds, we may
note that unhappy people write worse software, and less of it.  Given
the restricted nature of most electronic media, though, there will
often be no overt clue as to how a person is feeling.  You will have
to make an educated guess based on a) how most people would feel in
that situation, and b) what you know of this particular person from
past interactions.  Some people prefer a more hands-off attitude, and
simply deal with everyone at face value, the idea being that if a
participant doesn't say outright that she feels a particular way, then
one has no business treating her as though she does.  I don't buy this
approach, for a couple of reasons.  One, people don't behave that way
in real life, so why would they online?  Two, since most interactions
take place in public forums, people tend to be even more restrained in
expressing emotions than they might be in private.  To be more
precise, they are often willing to express emotions directed at
others, such as gratitude or outrage, but not emotions directed
inwardly, such as insecurity or pride.  Yet most humans work better
when they know that others are aware of their state of mind.  By
paying attention to small clues, you can usually guess right most of
the time, and motivate people to stay involved to a greater degree
than they otherwise might.</p><p>I don't mean, of course, that your role is to be a group
therapist, constantly helping everyone to get in touch with their
feelings.  But by paying careful attention to long-term patterns in
people's behavior, you will begin to get a sense of them as
individuals even if you never meet them face-to-face.  And by being
sensitive to the tone of your own writing, you can have a surprising
amount of influence over how others feel, to the ultimate benefit of
the project.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Recognizing Rudeness"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="rudeness"/>Recognizing Rudeness</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the defining characteristics of open source culture is
its distinctive notions of what does and does not constitute rudeness.
While the conventions described below are not unique to free software
development, nor even to software in general—they would be
familiar to anyone working in mathematics, the hard sciences, or
engineering disciplines—free software, with its porous
boundaries and constant influx of newcomers, is an environment where
these conventions are especially likely to be encountered by people
unfamiliar with them.</p><p>Let's start with the things that are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
rude:</p><p>Technical criticism, even when direct and unpadded, is not rude.
Indeed, it can be a form of flattery: the critic is saying, by
implication, that the target is worth taking seriously, and is worth
spending some time on.  That is, the more viable it would have been to
simply ignore someone's post, the more of a compliment it becomes to
take the time to criticize it (unless the critique descends into an
<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad hominem</em></span> attack or some other form of
obvious rudeness, of course).</p><p>Blunt, unadorned questions, such as Shane's questions to me in
the previously quoted email, are not rude either.  Questions that in
other contexts might seem cold, rhetorical, or even mocking, are often
intended seriously, and have no hidden agenda other than eliciting
information as quickly as possible.  The famous technical support
question "Is your computer plugged in?" is a classic example of this.
The support person really does need to know if your computer is
plugged in, and after the first few days on the job, has gotten tired
of prefixing her question with polite blandishments ("I beg your
pardon, I just want to ask a few simple questions to rule out some
possibilities.  Some of these might seem pretty basic, but bear with
me...").  At this point, she doesn't bother with the padding anymore,
she just asks straight out: is it plugged in or not?  Equivalent
questions are asked all the time on free software mailing lists.  The
intent is not to insult the recipient, but to quickly rule out the
most obvious (and perhaps most common) explanations.  Recipients who
understand this and react accordingly win points for taking a
broad-minded view without prompting.  But recipients who react badly
should not be reprimanded, either.  It's just a collision of cultures,
not anyone's fault.  Explain amiably that your question (or criticism)
had no hidden meanings; it was just meant to get (or transmit)
information as efficiently as possible, nothing more.</p><p>So what is rude?</p><p>By the same principle under which detailed technical criticism
is a form of flattery, failure to provide quality criticism can be a
kind of insult.  I don't mean simply ignoring someone's work, be it
proposal, code change, new issue filing, or whatever.  Unless you
explicitly promised a detailed reaction in advance, it's usually okay
to simply not react at all.  People will assume you just didn't have
time to say anything.  But if you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> react, don't
skimp: take the time to really analyze things, provide concrete
examples where appropriate, dig around in the archives to find related
posts from the past, etc.  Or if you don't have time to put in that
kind of effort, but still need to write some sort of brief response,
then state the shortcoming openly in your message ("I think there's an
issue filed for this, but unfortunately didn't have time to search for
it, sorry").  The main thing is to recognize the existence of the
cultural norm, either by fulfilling it or by openly acknowledging
that one has fallen short this time.  Either way, the norm is
strengthened.  But failing to meet that norm, while at the same time
not explaining <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you failed to meet it, is like
saying the topic (and those participating in it) was not worth much
of your time.  Better to show that your time is valuable by being
terse than by being lazy.</p><p>There are many other forms of rudeness, of course, but most of
them are not specific to free software development, and common sense
is a good enough guide to avoid them.  See also
<a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#prevent-rudeness" title="Nip Rudeness in the Bud">the section called “Nip Rudeness in the Bud”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started</em></a></span>, if you haven't
already.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Face"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="face"/>Face</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a region in the human brain devoted specifically to
recognizing faces.  It is known informally as the "fusiform face
area," and its capabilities are mostly inborn, not learned.  It turns
out that recognizing individual people is such a crucial survival
skill that we have evolved specialized hardware to do it.</p><p>Internet-based collaboration is therefore psychologically odd,
because it involves tight cooperation between human beings who almost
never get to identify each other by the most natural, intuitive
methods: facial recognition first of all, but also sound of voice,
posture, etc.  To compensate for this, try to use a consistent
<em class="firstterm">screen name</em> everywhere.  It should be the front
part of your email address (the part before the @-sign), your IRC
username, your repository committer name, your issue tracker username,
and so on.  This name is your online "face": a short identifying
string that serves some of the same purpose as your real face,
although it does not, unfortunately, stimulate the same built-in
hardware in the brain.</p><p>The screen name should be some intuitive permutation of your
real name (mine, for example, is "kfogel").  In some situations it
will be accompanied by your full name anyway, for example in mail
headers:</p><pre class="screen">
From: "Karl Fogel" &lt;kfogel@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre><p>Actually, there are two things going on in that example.  As
mentioned earlier, the screen name matches the real name in an
intuitive way.  But also, the real name is <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span>.
That is, it's not some made-up appellation like:</p><pre class="screen">
From: "Wonder Hacker" &lt;wonderhacker@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre><p>There's a famous cartoon by Paul Steiner, from the July 5, 1993
issue of <em class="citetitle">The New Yorker</em>, that shows one dog
logged into a computer terminal, looking down and telling another
conspiratorially: "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog."  This
kind of thought probably lies behind a lot of the self-aggrandizing,
meant-to-be-hip online identities people give themselves—as if
calling oneself "Wonder Hacker" will actually cause people to believe
one <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a wonderful hacker.  But the fact remains:
even if no one knows you're a dog, you're still a dog.  A fantastical
online identity never impresses readers.  Instead, it makes them think
you're more into image than substance, or that you're simply insecure.
Use your real name for all interactions, or if for some reason you
require anonymity, then make up a name that sounds like a perfectly
normal real name, and use it consistently.</p><p>In addition to keeping your online face consistent, there are
some things you can do to make it more attractive.  If you have an
official title (e.g., "doctor", "professor", "director"), don't flaunt
it, nor even mention it except when it's directly relevant to the
conversation.  Hackerdom in general, and free software culture in
particular, tends to view title displays as exclusionary and a sign of
insecurity.  It's okay if your title appears as part of a standard
signature block at the end of every mail you send, just don't ever use
it as a tool to bolster your position in a discussion—the
attempt is guaranteed to backfire.  You want folks to respect the
person, not the title.</p><p>Speaking of signature blocks: keep them small and tasteful, or
better yet, nonexistent.  Avoid large legal disclaimers tacked on to
the end of every mail, especially when they express sentiments
incompatible with participation in a free software project.  For
example, the following classic of the genre appears at the end of
every post a particular user makes to a public mailing list I'm
on:</p><pre class="screen">
