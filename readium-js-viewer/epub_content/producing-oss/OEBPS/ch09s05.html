and documentation that were contributed to by many people.  The first
is to ignore the issue of copyright entirely (I don't recommend this).
The second is to collect a <em class="firstterm">contributor license
agreement</em> (<em class="firstterm">CLA</em>) from each person
who works on the project, explicitly granting the project the right to
use that person's contributions.  This is usually enough for most
projects, and the nice thing is that in some jurisdictions, CLAs can
be sent in by email.  The third way is to get actual copyright
assignments from contributors, so that the project (i.e., some legal
entity, usually a nonprofit) is the copyright owner for everything.
This is the most legally airtight way, but it's also the most
burdensome for contributors; only a few projects insist on
it.<sup>[<a id="idp8845536" href="#ftn.idp8845536" class="footnote">32</a>]</sup></p><p>Note that even under centralized copyright ownership, the
code<sup>[<a id="idp8846544" href="#ftn.idp8846544" class="footnote">33</a>]</sup> remains free, because
open source licenses do not give the copyright holder the right to
retroactively proprietize all copies of the code.  So even if the
project, as a legal entity, were to suddenly turn around and started
distributing all the code under a restrictive license, that wouldn't
cause a problem for the public community.  The other developers would
simply start a fork based on the latest free copy of the code, and
continue as if nothing had happened.  Because they know they can do
this, most contributors cooperate when asked to sign a CLA or an
assignment of copyright.</p><div class="sect2" title="Doing Nothing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="copyright-assignment-none"/>Doing Nothing</h2></div></div></div><p>Most projects never collect CLAs or copyright assignments from
their contributors.  Instead, they accept code whenever it seems
reasonably clear that the contributor intended it to be incorporated
into the project.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this is okay.  But every now and
then, someone may decide to sue for copyright infringement, alleging
that they are the true owner of the code in question and that they
never agreed to its being distributed by the project under an open
source license.  For example, the SCO Group did something like this to
the Linux project, see
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies</a>
for details.  When this happens, the project will have no
documentation showing that the contributor formally granted the right
to use the code, which could make some legal defenses more
difficult.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Contributor License Agreements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="copyright-assignment-cla"/>Contributor License Agreements</h2></div></div></div><p>CLAs probably offer the best tradeoff between safety and
convenience.  A CLA is typically an electronic form that a developer
fills out and sends in to the project.  In many jurisdictions, email
submission is enough.  A secure digital signature may or may not be
required; consult a lawyer to find out what method would be best for
your project.</p><p>Most projects use two slightly different CLAs, one for
individuals, and one for corporate contributors.  But in both types,
the core language is the same: the contributor grants the
project <span class="emphasis"><em>"...perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute [the] Contributions and such derivative
works."</em></span> Again, you should have a lawyer approve any CLA,
but if you get all those adjectives into it, you're probably
fine.</p><p>When you request CLAs from contributors, make sure to emphasize
that you are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> asking for actual copyright
assignment.  In fact, many CLAs start out by reminding the reader of
this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This is a license agreement only; it does not transfer
copyright ownership and does not change your rights to use your own
Contributions for any other purpose.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Here are some examples:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Individual contributor CLAs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://apache.org/licenses/icla.txt">http://apache.org/licenses/icla.txt</a>

project copyright ownership on her contributions.  Ideally, this is
done on paper and either faxed or snail-mailed to the project.</p><p>Some projects insist on full assignment because having a single
legal entity own the copyright on the entire code base can be useful
if the terms of the open source license ever need to be enforced in
court.  If no single entity has the right to do it, all the
contributors might have to cooperate, but some might not have time or
even be reachable when the issue arises.</p><p>Different organizations apply different amounts of rigor to the
task of collecting assignments.  Some simply get an informal statement
from a contributor on a public list mailing listâ€”something to
the effect of "I hereby assign copyright in this code to the project,
to be licensed under the same terms as the rest of the code."  At
least one lawyer I've talked to says that's really enough, presumably
because it happens in a context where copyright assignment is normal
and expected anyway, and because it represents a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">bona
fide</em></span> effort on the project's part to ascertain the
developer's true intentions.  On the other hand, the Free Software
Foundation goes to the opposite extreme: they require contributors to
physically sign and mail in a piece of paper containing a formal
statement of copyright assignment, sometimes for just one
contribution, sometimes for current and future contributions.  If the
developer is employed, the FSF asks that the employer sign it
too.</p><p>The FSF's paranoia is understandable.  If someone violates the
terms of the GPL by incorporating some of their software into a
proprietary program, the FSF will need to fight that in court, and
they want their copyrights to be as airtight as possible when that
happens.  Since the FSF is copyright holder for a lot of popular
software, they view this as a real possibility.  Whether your
organization needs to be similarly scrupulous is something only you
can decide, in consultation with lawyers.  In general, unless there's
some specific reason why your project needs full copyright assignment,
just go with CLAs; they're easier for everyone.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp8845536" href="#idp8845536" class="para">32</a>] </sup>Also, actual copyright transferral is subject to
