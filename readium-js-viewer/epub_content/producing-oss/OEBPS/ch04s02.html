benevolent dictatorship model and toward more openly democratic
systems.  This is not necessarily out of dissatisfaction with a
particular BD.  It's simply that group-based governance is more
"evolutionarily stable", to borrow a biological metaphor.  Whenever a
benevolent dictator steps down, or attempts to spread decision-making
responsibility more evenly, it is an opportunity for the group to
settle on a new, non-dictatorial system—establish a
constitution, as it were.  The group may not take this opportunity the
first time, or the second, but eventually they will; once they do,
the decision is unlikely ever to be reversed.  Common sense explains
why: if a group of N people were to vest one person with special
power, it would mean that N - 1 people were each agreeing to
decrease their individual influence.  People usually don't want to do
that.  Even if they did, the resulting dictatorship would still be
conditional: the group anointed the BD, clearly the group could depose
the BD.  Therefore, once a project has moved from leadership by a
charismatic individual to a more formal, group-based system, it rarely
moves back.</p><p>The details of how these systems work vary widely, but there are
two common elements: one, the group works by consensus most of the
time; two, there is a formal voting mechanism to fall back on when
consensus cannot be reached.</p><p><em class="firstterm">Consensus</em> merely means an agreement that
everyone is willing to live with.  It is not an ambiguous state: a
group has reached consensus on a given question when someone proposes
that consensus has been reached, and no one contradicts the assertion.
The person proposing consensus should, of course, state specifically
what the consensus is, and what actions would be taken in consequence
of it, if they're not obvious.</p><p>Most conversation in a project is on technical topics, such as
the right way to fix a certain bug, whether or not to add a feature,
how strictly to document interfaces, etc.  Consensus-based governance
works well because it blends seamlessly with the technical discussion
itself.  By the end of a discussion, there is often general agreement
on what course to take.  Someone will usually make a concluding post,
which is simultaneously a summary of what has been decided and an
implicit proposal of consensus.  This provides a last chance for
someone else to say "Wait, I didn't agree to that.  We need to hash
this out some more."</p><p>For small, uncontroversial decisions, the proposal of consensus
is implicit.  For example, when a developer spontaneously commits a
bugfix, the commit itself is a proposal of consensus: "I assume we all
agree that this bug needs to be fixed, and that this is the way to fix
it."  Of course, the developer does not actually say that; she just
commits the fix, and the others in the project do not bother to state
their agreement, because silence is consent.  If someone commits a
change that turns out <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have consensus, the
result is simply for the project to discuss the change as though it
had not already been committed.  The reason this works is the topic of
the next section.</p><div class="sect2" title="Version Control Means You Can Relax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="version-control-relaxation"/>Version Control Means You Can Relax</h2></div></div></div><p>The fact that the project's source code is kept under version
control means that most decisions can be easily unmade.  The most
common way this happens is that someone commits a change mistakenly
thinking everyone would be happy with it, only to be met with
objections after the fact.  It is typical for such objections to start
out with an obligatory apology for having missed out on prior
discussion, though this may be omitted if the objector finds no record
of such a discussion in the mailing list archives.  Either way, there
is no reason for the tone of the discussion to be different after the
change has been committed than before.  Any change can be reverted, at
least until dependent changes are introduced (i.e., new code that
would break if the original change were suddenly removed).  The
version control system gives the project a way to undo the effects of
bad or hasty judgement.  This, in turn, frees people to trust their
instincts about how much feedback is necessary before doing
something.</p><p>This also means that the process of establishing consensus need
not be very formal.  Most projects handle it by feel.  Minor changes
can go in with no discussion, or with minimal discussion followed by a
few nods of agreement.  For more significant changes, especially ones
with the potential to destabilize a lot of code, people should wait a
day or two before assuming there is consensus, the rationale being
that no one should be marginalized in an important conversation simply
because he didn't check email frequently enough.</p><p>Thus, when someone is confident he knows what needs to be done,
he should just go ahead and do it.  This applies not only to software
fixes, but to web site updates, documentation changes, and anything
else unlikely to be controversial.  Usually there will be only a few
instances where an action needs to be undone, and these can be handled on
a case-by-case basis.  Of course, one shouldn't encourage people to be
headstrong.  There is still a psychological difference between a
decision under discussion and one that has already taken effect, even
if it is technically reversible.  People always feel that momentum is
allied to action, and will be slightly more reluctant to revert a
change than to prevent it in the first place.  If a developer abuses
this fact by committing potentially controversial changes too quickly,
however, people can and should complain, and hold that developer to a
stricter standard until things improve.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="When Consensus Cannot Be Reached, Vote"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="voting"/>When Consensus Cannot Be Reached, Vote</h2></div></div></div><p>Inevitably, some debates just won't consense.  When all other
means of breaking a deadlock fail, the solution is to vote.  But
before a vote can be taken, there must be a clear set of choices on
the ballot.  Here, again, the normal process of technical discussion
blends serendipitously with the project's decision-making procedures.
The kinds of questions that come to a vote often involve complex,
multifaceted issues.  In any such complex discussion, there are
usually one or two people playing the role of <em class="firstterm">honest
broker</em>: posting periodic summaries of the various
arguments and keeping track of where the core points of disagreement
(and agreement) lie.  These summaries help everyone measure how much
progress has been made, and remind everyone of what issues remain to
be addressed.  Those same summaries can serve as prototypes for a
ballot sheet, should a vote become necessary.  If the honest brokers
have been doing their job well, they will be able to credibly call for
a vote when the time comes, and the group will be willing to use a
ballot sheet based on their summary of the issues.  The brokers
themselves may be participants in the debate; it is not necessary for
them to remain above the fray, as long as they can understand and
fairly represent others' views, and not let their partisan sentiments
prevent them from summarizing the state of the debate in a neutral
fashion.</p><p>The actual content of the ballot is usually not controversial.
By the time matters reach a vote, the disagreement has usually boiled
down to a few key issues, with recognizable labels and brief
descriptions.  Occasionally a developer will object to the form of the
ballot itself.  Sometimes his concern is legitimate, for example,
that an important choice was left off or not described accurately.
But other times a developer may be merely trying to stave off the
inevitable, perhaps knowing that the vote probably won't go his way.

in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span> for how to deal with
this sort of obstructionism.</p><p>Remember to specify the voting system, as there are many
different kinds, and people might make wrong assumptions about which
procedure is being used.  A good choice in most cases is
<em class="firstterm">approval voting</em>, whereby each voter can vote
for as many of the choices on the ballot as he likes.  Approval
voting is simple to explain and to count, and unlike some other
methods, it only involves one round of voting.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#List_of_systems">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#List_of_systems</a> for
more details about approval voting and other voting systems, but try
to avoid getting into a long debate about which voting system to use
(because, of course, you will then find yourself in a debate about
which voting system to use to decide the voting system!).  One reason
approval voting is a good choice is that it's very hard for anyone to
object to—it's about as fair as a voting system can be.</p><p>Finally, conduct votes in public.  There is no need for secrecy
or anonymity in a vote on matters that have been debated publicly
anyway.  Have each participant post her votes to the project mailing
list, so that any observer can tally and check the results for
herself, and so that everything is recorded in the archives.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="When To Vote"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="when-to-vote"/>When To Vote</h2></div></div></div><p>The hardest thing about voting is determining when to do it.  In
general, taking a vote should be very rare—a last resort for
when all other options have failed.  Don't think of voting as a great
way to resolve debates.  It isn't.  It ends discussion, and thereby
ends creative thinking about the problem.  As long as discussion
continues, there is the possibility that someone will come up with a
new solution everyone likes.  This happens surprisingly often: a
lively debate can produce a new way of thinking about the problem, and
lead to a proposal that eventually satisfies everyone.  Even when no
new proposal arises, it's still usually better to broker a compromise
than to hold a vote.  After a compromise, everyone is a little bit
unhappy, whereas after a vote, some people are unhappy while others
are happy.  From a political standpoint, the former situation is
preferable: at least each person can feel he extracted a price for his
unhappiness.  He may be dissatisfied, but so is everyone else.</p><p>Voting's main advantage is that it finally settles a question so
everyone can move on.  But it settles it by a head count, instead of
by rational dialogue leading everyone to the same conclusion.  The
more experienced people are with open source projects, the less eager
I find them to be to settle questions by vote.  Instead they will try
to explore previously unconsidered solutions, or compromise more
severely than they'd originally planned.  Various techniques are
available to prevent a premature vote.  The most obvious is simply to
say "I don't think we're ready for a vote yet," and explain why not.
Another is to ask for an informal (non-binding) show of hands.  If the
response clearly tends toward one side or another, this will make some
people suddenly more willing to compromise, obviating the need for a
formal vote.  But the most effective way is simply to offer a new
solution, or a new viewpoint on an old suggestion, so that people
re-engage with the issues instead of merely repeating the same
arguments.</p><p>In certain rare cases, everyone may agree that all the
compromise solutions are worse than any of the non-compromise ones.
When that happens, voting is less objectionable, both because it is
more likely to lead to a superior solution and because people will not
be overly unhappy no matter how it turns out.  Even then, the vote
should not be rushed.  The discussion leading up to a vote is what
educates the electorate, so stopping that discussion early can lower
the quality of the result.</p><p>(Note that this advice to be reluctant to call votes does not
apply to the change-inclusion voting described in
<a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html" title="Stabilizing a Release">the section called “Stabilizing a Release”</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Chapter 7, <em>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</em></a></span>.  There, voting
is more of a communications mechanism, a means of registering one's
involvement in the change review process so that everyone can tell how
much review a given change has received.)</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Who Votes?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="electorate"/>Who Votes?</h2></div></div></div><p>Having a voting system raises the question of electorate: who
gets to vote?  This has the potential to be a sensitive issue, because
it forces the project to officially recognize some people as being
more involved, or as having better judgement, than others.</p><p>The best solution is to simply take an existing distinction,
commit access, and attach voting privileges to it.  In projects that
offer both full and partial commit access, the question of whether
partial committers can vote largely depends on the process by which
partial commit access is granted.  If the project hands it out
liberally, for example as a way of maintaining many third-party
contributed tools in the repository, then it should be made clear that
partial commit access is really just about committing, not voting.
The reverse implication naturally holds as well: since full committers
<span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> have voting privileges, they must be chosen
not only as programmers, but as members of the electorate.  If someone
shows disruptive or obstructionist tendencies on the mailing list, the
group should be very cautious about making him a committer, even if
the person is technically skilled.</p><p>The voting system itself should be used to choose new
committers, both full and partial.  But here is one of the rare
instances where secrecy is appropriate.  You can't have votes about
potential committers posted to a public mailing list, because the
candidate's feelings (and reputation) could be hurt.  Instead, the
usual way is that an existing committer posts to a private mailing
list consisting only of the other committers, proposing that someone
be granted commit access.  The other committers speak their minds
freely, knowing the discussion is private.  Often there will be no
disagreement, and therefore no vote necessary.  After waiting a few
days to make sure every committer has had a chance to respond, the
proposer mails the candidate and offers him commit access.  If there
is disagreement, discussion ensues as for any other question, possibly
resulting in a vote.  For this process to be open and frank, the mere
fact that the discussion is taking place at all should be secret.  If
the person under consideration knew it was going on, and then were
never offered commit access, he could conclude that he had lost
the vote, and would likely feel hurt.  Of course, if someone
explicitly asks for commit access, then there is no choice but to
consider the proposal and explicitly accept or reject him.  If the
latter, then it should be done as politely as possible, with a clear
explanation: "We liked your patches, but haven't seen enough of them
yet," or "We appreciate all your patches, but they required
considerable adjustments before they could be applied, so we don't
feel comfortable giving you commit access yet.  We hope that this will
change over time, though."  Remember, what you're saying could come as
a blow, depending on the person's level of confidence.  Try to see it
from their point of view as you write the mail.</p><p>Because adding a new committer is more consequential than most
other one-time decisions, some projects have special requirements for
the vote.  For example, they may require that the proposal receive at
least <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> positive votes and no negative votes, or
that a supermajority vote in favor.  The exact parameters are not
important; the main idea is to get the group to be careful about
adding new committers.  Similar, or even stricter, special requirements
can apply to votes to <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> a committer, though
hopefully that will never be necessary.  See <a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html" title="Committers">the section called “Committers”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Managing Volunteers">Chapter 8, <em>Managing Volunteers</em></a></span> for more on the
non-voting aspects of adding and removing committers.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Polls Versus Votes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="polls"/>Polls Versus Votes</h2></div></div></div><p>For certain kinds of votes, it may be useful to expand the
electorate. For example, if the developers simply can't figure out
whether a given interface choice matches the way people actually use
the software, one solution is to ask to all the subscribers of the
project's mailing lists to vote.  These are really
<em class="firstterm">polls</em> rather than votes, but the developers may
choose to treat the result as binding.  As with any poll, be sure to
make it clear to the participants that there's a write-in option: if
someone thinks of a better option not offered in the poll questions,
her response may turn out to be the most important result of the
poll.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Vetoes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="veto"/>Vetoes</h2></div></div></div><p>Some projects allow a special kind of vote known as a
<em class="firstterm">veto</em>.  A veto is a way for a developer to put a
halt to a hasty or ill-considered change, at least long enough for
everyone to discuss it more.  Think of a veto as somewhere between a
very strong objection and a filibuster.  Its exact meaning varies from
one project to another.  Some projects make it very difficult to
override a veto; others allow them to be overridden by regular
majority vote, perhaps after an enforced delay for more discussion.
Any veto should be accompanied by a thorough explanation; a veto
without such an explanation should be considered invalid on
arrival.</p><p>With vetoes comes the problem of veto abuse.  Sometimes
developers are too eager to raise the stakes by casting a veto, when
really all that was called for was more discussion.  You can prevent
veto abuse by being very reluctant to use vetoes yourself, and by
gently calling it out when someone else uses her veto too often.  If
necessary, you can also remind the group that vetoes are binding for
only as long as the group agrees they are—after all, if a
clear majority of developers wants X, then X is going to happen one
way or another.  Either the vetoing developer will back down, or the
group will decide to weaken the meaning of a veto.</p><p>You may see people write "-1" to express a veto.  This usage
comes from the Apache Software Foundation, which has a highly
structured voting and veto process, described at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html</a>.  The Apache
standards have spread to other projects, and you will see their
conventions used to varying degrees in a lot of places in the open
source world.  Technically, "-1" does not always indicate a formal
veto even according to the Apache standards, but informally it is
usually taken to mean a veto, or at least a very strong
objection.</p><p>Like votes, vetoes can apply retroactively.  It's not okay to
object to a veto on the grounds that the change in question has
already been committed, or the action taken (unless it's something
irrevocable, like putting out a press release).  On the other hand, a
veto that arrives weeks or months late isn't likely to be taken very
seriously, nor should it be.</p></div></div></body></html>
