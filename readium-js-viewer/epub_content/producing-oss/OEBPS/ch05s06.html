projects.  Ideally, you want a contractor's work to be accepted by the
community and folded into the public distribution.  In theory, it
wouldn't matter who the contractor is, as long as his work is good and
meets the project's guidelines.  Theory and practice can sometimes
match, too: a complete stranger who shows up with a good patch
<span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> generally be able to get it into the
software.  The trouble is, it's very hard to produce a good patch for
a non-trivial enhancement or new feature while truly being a complete
stranger; one must first discuss it with the rest of the project.  The
duration of that discussion cannot be precisely predicted.  If the
contractor is paid by the hour, you may end up paying more than you
expected; if he is paid a flat sum, he may end up doing more work
than he can afford.</p><p>There are two ways around this.  The preferred way is to make an
educated guess about the length of the discussion process, based on
past experience, add in some padding for error, and base the contract
on that.  It also helps to divide the problem into as many small,
independent chunks as possible, to increase the predictability of each
chunk.  The other way is to contract solely for delivery of a patch,
and treat the patch's acceptance into the public project as a separate
matter.  Then it becomes much easier to write the contract, but you're
stuck with the burden of maintaining a private patch for as long as
you depend on the software, or at least for as long as it takes you to
get that patch or equivalent functionality into the mainline.  Of
course, even with the preferred way, the contract itself cannot
require that the patch be accepted into the code, because that would
involve selling something that's not for sale.  (What if the rest of
the project unexpectedly decides not to support the feature?)
However, the contract can require a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">bona
fide</em></span> effort to get the change accepted by the
community, and that it be committed to the repository if the community
agrees with it.  For example, if the project has written standards
regarding code changes, the contract can reference those standards and
specify that the work must meet them.  In practice, this usually works
out the way everyone hopes.</p><p>The best tactic for successful contracting is to hire one of the
project's developers—preferably a committer—as the
contractor.  This may seem like a form of purchasing influence, and,
well, it is.  But it's not as corrupt as it might seem.  A developer's
influence in the project is due mainly to the quality of his code and
to his interactions with other developers.  The fact that he has a
contract to get certain things done doesn't raise his status in any
way, and doesn't lower it either, though it may make people scrutinize
him more carefully.  Most developers would not risk their long-term
position in the project by backing an inappropriate or widely disliked
new feature.  In fact, part of what you get, or should get, when you
hire such a contractor is advice about what sorts of changes are
likely to be accepted by the community.  You also get a slight shift
in the project's priorities.  Because prioritization is just a matter
of who has time to work on what, when you pay for someone's time, you
cause their work to move up in the priority queue a bit.  This is a
well-understood fact of life among experienced open source developers,
and at least some of them will devote attention to the contractor's
work simply because it looks like it's going to <span class="emphasis"><em>get
done</em></span>, so they want to help it get done right.  Perhaps they
won't write any of the code, but they'll still discuss the design and
review the code, both of which can be very useful.  For all these
reasons, the contractor is best drawn from the ranks of those already
involved with the project.</p><p>This immediately raises two questions: Should contracts ever be
private?  And when they're not, should you worry about creating
tensions in the community by the fact that you've contracted with some
developers and not others?</p><p>It's best to be open about contracts, when you can.  Otherwise,
the contractor's behavior may seem strange to others in the
community—perhaps he's suddenly giving inexplicably high
priority to features he's never shown interest in the past.  When
people ask him why he wants them now, how can he answer convincingly
if he can't talk about the fact that he's been contracted to write
them?</p><p>At the same time, neither you nor the contractor should act as
though others should treat your arrangement as a big deal.  Too often
I've seen contractors waltz onto a development list with the attitude
that their posts should be taken more seriously simply because they're
being paid.  That kind of attitude signals to the rest of the project
that the contractor regards the fact of the contract—as opposed
to the code <span class="emphasis"><em>resulting</em></span> from the contract—to
be the important thing.  But from the other developers' point of view,
only the code matters.  At all times, the focus of attention should be
kept on technical issues, not on the details of who is paying whom.
For example, one of the developers in the Subversion community handles
contracting in a particularly graceful way.  While discussing his code
changes in IRC, he'll mention as an aside (often in a private remark,
an IRC <em class="firstterm">privmsg</em>, to one of the other committers)
that he's being paid for his work on this particular bug or feature.
But he also consistently gives the impression that he'd want to be
working on that change anyway, and that he's happy the money is making
it possible for him to do that.  He may or may not reveal his
customer's identity, but in any case he doesn't dwell on the contract.
His remarks about it are just an ornament to an otherwise technical
discussion about how to get something done.</p><p>That example shows another reason why it's good to be open about
contracts.  There may be multiple organizations sponsoring contracts
on a given open source project, and if each knows what the others are
trying to do, they may be able to pool their resources.  In the above
case, the project's largest funder (CollabNet) is not involved in any
way with these piecework contracts, but knowing that someone else is
sponsoring certain bug fixes allows CollabNet to redirect its
resources to other bugs, resulting in greater efficiency for the
project as a whole.</p><p>Will other developers resent that some are paid for working on
the project?  In general, no, particularly when those who are paid are
established, well-respected members of the community anyway.  No one
expects contract work to be distributed equally among all the
committers.  People understand the importance of long-term
relationships: the uncertainties involved in contracting are such that
once you find someone you can work reliably with, you would be
reluctant to switch to a different person just for the sake of
evenhandedness.  Think of it this way: the first time you hire, there
will be no complaints, because clearly you had to pick
<span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span>—it's not your fault you can't hire
everyone.  Later, when you hire the same person a second time, that's
just common sense: you already know him, the last time was
successful, so why take unnecessary risks?  Thus, it's perfectly
natural to have one or two go-to people in the community, instead of
spreading the work around evenly.</p><div class="sect2" title="Review and Acceptance of Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="community-review-acceptance"/>Review and Acceptance of Changes</h2></div></div></div><p>The community is still important to the success of contract
work.  Their involvement in the design and review process for sizeable
changes cannot be an afterthought.  It must be considered part of the
work, and fully embraced by the contractor.  Don't think of community
scrutiny as an obstacle to be overcome—think of it as a free
design board and QA department.  It is a benefit to be aggressively
pursued, not merely endured.</p><div class="sect3" title="Case study: the CVS password-authentication protocol"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="cvs-pserver"/>Case study: the CVS password-authentication protocol</h3></div></div></div><p>In 1995, I was one half of a partnership that provided support
and enhancements for CVS (the Concurrent Versions System; see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cvshome.org/">http://www.cvshome.org/</a>).  My partner Jim and I were,
informally, the maintainers of CVS by that point.  But we'd never
thought carefully about how we ought to relate to the existing, mostly
volunteer CVS development community.  We just assumed that they'd send
in patches, and we'd apply them, and that was pretty much how it
worked.</p><p>Back then, networked CVS could be done only over a remote login
program such as <code class="literal">rsh</code>.  Using the same password for
CVS access as for login access was an obvious security risk, and many
organizations were put off by it.  A major investment bank hired us to
add a new authentication mechanism, so they could safely use networked
CVS with their remote offices.</p><p>Jim and I took the contract and sat down to design the new
authentication system.  What we came up with was pretty simple (the
United States had export controls on cryptographic code at the time,
so the customer understood that we couldn't implement strong
authentication), but as we were not experienced in designing such
protocols, we still made a few gaffes that would have been obvious to
an expert.  These mistakes would easily have been caught had we taken
the time to write up a proposal and run it by the other developers for
review.  But we never did so, because it didn't occur to us to think
of the development list as a resource to be used.  We knew that people
were probably going to accept whatever we committed, and—because
we didn't know what we didn't know—we didn't bother to do the
work in a visible way, e.g., posting patches frequently, making small,
easily digestible commits to a special branch, etc.  The resulting
authentication protocol was not very good, and of course, once it
became established, it was difficult to improve, because of
compatibility concerns.</p><p>The root of the problem was not lack of experience; we could
easily have learned what we needed to know.  The problem was our
attitude toward the volunteer development community.  We regarded
acceptance of the changes as a hurdle to leap, rather than as a
process by which the quality of the changes could be improved.  Since
we were confident that almost anything we did would be accepted (as it
was), we made little effort to get others involved.</p></div><p>Obviously, when you're choosing a contractor, you want someone
with the right technical skills and experience for the job.  But it's
also important to choose someone with a track record of constructive
interaction with the other developers in the community.  That way
you're getting more than just a single person; you're getting an agent
who will be able to draw on a network of expertise to make sure the
work is done in a robust and maintainable way.</p></div></div></body></html>
