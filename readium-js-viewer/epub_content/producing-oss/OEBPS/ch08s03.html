responsibility (e.g., patch manager, translation manager, etc.) will
become unable to perform the duties of the position.  It may be
because the job turned out to be more work than he anticipated, or it
may be due to completely external factors: marriage, a new baby, a new
employer, or whatever.</p><p>When a volunteer gets swamped like this, he usually doesn't
notice it right away.  It happens by slow degrees, and there's no
point at which he consciously realizes that he can no longer fulfill
the duties of the role.  Instead, the rest of the project just doesn't
hear much from him for a while.  Then there will suddenly be a flurry
of activity, as he feels guilty for neglecting the project for so long
and sets aside a night to catch up.  Then you won't hear from him for
a while longer, and then there might or might not be another flurry.
But there's rarely an unsolicited formal resignation.  The volunteer
was doing the job in his spare time, so resigning would mean openly
acknowledging to himself that his spare time is permanently reduced.
People are often reluctant to do that.</p><p>Therefore, it's up to you and the others in the project to
notice what's happening—or rather, not happening—and to
ask the volunteer what's going on.  The inquiry should be friendly and
100% guilt-free.  Your purpose is to find out a piece
of information, not to make the person feel bad.  Generally, the
inquiry should be visible to the rest of the project, but if you know
of some special reason why a private inquiry would be better, that's
fine too.  The main reason to do it publicly is so that if the
volunteer responds by saying that he won't be able to do the job
anymore, there's a context established for your
<span class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> public post: a request for a new volunteer
to fill that role.</p><p>Sometimes, a volunteer is unable to do the job he's taken on,
but is either unaware or unwilling to admit that fact.  Of course,
anyone may have trouble at first, especially if the responsibility is
complex.  However, if someone just isn't working out in the task he's
taken on, even after everyone else has given all the help and
suggestions they can, then the only solution is for him to step aside
and let someone new have a try.  And if the person doesn't see this
himself, he'll need to be told.  There's basically only one way to
handle this, I think, but it's a multistep process and each step is
important.</p><p>First, make sure you're not crazy.  Privately talk to others in
the project to see if they agree that the problem is as serious as you
think it is.  Even if you're already positive, this serves the purpose
of letting others know that you're considering asking the person to
step aside.  Usually no one will object to that—they'll just be
happy you're taking on the awkward task, so they don't have to!</p><p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>privately</em></span> contact the volunteer in
question and tell him, kindly but directly, about the problems you
see.  Be specific, giving as many examples as possible.  Make sure to
point out how people had tried to help, but that the problems
persisted without improving.  You should expect this email to take a
long time to write, but with this sort of message, if you don't back
up what you're saying, you shouldn't say it at all.  Say that you
would like to find a new volunteer to fill the role, but also point
out that there are many other ways to contribute to the project.  At
this stage, don't say that you've talked to others about it; nobody
likes to be told that people were conspiring behind his back.</p><p>There are a few different ways things can go after that.  The
most likely reaction is that he'll agree with you, or at any rate not
want to argue, and be willing to step down.  In that case, suggest
that he make the announcement himself, and then you can follow up with
a post seeking a replacement.</p><p>Or, he may agree that there have been problems, but ask for a
little more time (or for one more chance, in the case of discrete-task
roles like release manager).  How you react to that is a judgement
call, but whatever you do, don't agree to it just because you feel
like you can't refuse such a reasonable request.  That would prolong
the agony, not lessen it.  There is often a very good reason to refuse
the request, namely, that there have already been plenty of chances,
and that's how things got to where they are now.  Here's how I put it
in a mail to someone who was filling the release manager role but was
not really suited for it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="screen">
&gt; If you wish to replace me with some one else, I will gracefully
&gt; pass on the role to who comes next.  I have one request, which
&gt; I hope is not unreasonable.  I would like to attempt one more
&gt;  release in an effort to prove myself.

I totally understand the desire (been there myself!), but in
this case, we shouldn't do the "one more try" thing.

This isn't the first or second release, it's the sixth or
seventh... And for all of those, I know you've been dissatisfied
with the results too (because we've talked about it before).  So
we've effectively already been down the one-more-try route.
Eventually, one of the tries has to be the last one... I think
[this past release] should be it.
</pre></blockquote></div><p>In the worst case, the volunteer may disagree outright.  Then
you have to accept that things are going to be awkward and plow ahead
anyway.  Now is the time to say that you talked to other people about
it (but still don't say who until you have their permission, since
those conversations were confidential), and that you don't think it's
good for the project to continue as things are.  Be insistent, but
never threatening.  Keep in mind that with most roles, the transition
really happens the moment someone new starts doing the job,
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the moment the old person stops doing it.
For example, if the contention is over the role of, say, issue
manager, at any point you and other influential people in the project
can solicit for a new issue manager.  It's not actually necessary that
the person who was previously doing it stop doing it, as long as he
does not sabotage (deliberately or otherwise) the efforts of the new
volunteer.</p><p>Which leads to a tempting thought: instead of asking the person
to resign, why not just frame it as a matter of getting him some help?
Why not just have two issue managers, or patch managers, or whatever
the role is?</p><p>Although that may sound nice in theory, it is generally not a
good idea.  What makes the manager roles work—what makes them
useful, in fact—is their centralization.  Those things that can
be done in a decentralized fashion are usually already being done that
way.  Having two people fill one managerial role introduces
communications overhead between those two people, as well as the
potential for slippery displacement of responsibility ("I thought you
brought the first aid kit!"  "Me?  No, I thought
<span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> brought the first aid kit!").  Of course,
there are exceptions.  Sometimes two people work extremely well
together, or the nature of the role is such that it can easily be
spread across multiple people.  But these are not likely to be of much
use when you see someone flailing in a role he is not suited for.  If
he'd appreciated the problem in the first place, he would have sought
such help before now.  In any case, it would be disrespectful to let
someone waste time continuing to do a job no one will pay attention
to.</p><p>The most important factor in asking someone to step down is
privacy: giving him the space to make a decision without feeling like
others are watching and waiting.  I once made the mistake—an
obvious mistake, in retrospect—of mailing all three parties at
once in order to ask Subversion's release manager to step aside in
favor of two other volunteers.  I'd already talked to the two new
people privately, and knew that they were willing to take on the
responsibility.  So I thought, naïvely and somewhat
insensitively, that I'd save some time and hassle by sending one mail
to all of them to initiate the transition.  I assumed that the current
release manager was already fully aware of the problems and would see
the reasonableness of my point immediately.</p><p>I was wrong.  The current release manager was very offended, and
rightly so.  It's one thing to be asked to hand off the job; it's
another thing to be asked that <span class="emphasis"><em>in front of</em></span> the
people you'll hand it off to.  Once I got it through my head why he
was offended, I apologized.  He eventually did step aside gracefully,
and continues to be involved with the project today.  But his
feelings were hurt, and needless to say, this was not the most
auspicious of beginnings for the new volunteers either.</p></div></body></html>
