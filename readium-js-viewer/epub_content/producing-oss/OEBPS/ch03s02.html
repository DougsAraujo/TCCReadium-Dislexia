communications.  If a user is exposed to any forum besides the web
pages, it is most likely to be one of the project's mailing lists.
But before they experience the mailing list itself, they will
experience the mailing list interface—that is, the mechanism
by which they join ("subscribe to") the list.  This brings us to Rule
#1 of mailing lists:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Don't try to manage mailing lists by hand—get
   list management software.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>It will be tempting to put this off.  Setting up mailing list
management software might seem like overkill at first.  Managing
small, low-traffic lists by hand will seem seductively easy: you just
set up a subscription address that forwards to you, and when someone
mails it, you add (or remove) their email address in some text file
that holds all the addresses on the list.  What could be
simpler?</p><p>The trick is that good mailing list management—which is
what people have come to expect—is not simple at all.  It's not
just about subscribing and unsubscribing users when they request.
It's also about moderating to prevent spam, offering the mailing list
in digest versus message-by-message form, providing standard list and
project information by means of auto-responders, and various other
things.  A human being monitoring a subscription address can supply
only a bare minimum of functionality, and even then not as reliably
and promptly as software could.</p><p>Modern list management software usually offers at least the
following features:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Both email- and web-based subscription</span></dt><dd><p>When a user subscribes to a list, she should
            <span class="emphasis"><em>promptly</em></span> get an automated welcome
            message in reply, telling her what she has subscribed
            to, how to interact further with the mailing list
            software, and (most importantly) how to unsubscribe.  This
            automatic reply can be customized to contain
            project-specific information, of course, such as the
            project's web site, FAQ location, etc.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Subscription in either digest mode or
                      message-by-message mode</span></dt><dd><p>In digest mode, the subscriber receives one email per day,
            containing all the list activity for that day.  For people
            who are following a list loosely, without participating,
            digest mode is often preferable, because it allows them to
            scan all the subjects at once and avoid the distraction
            of emails coming in at random times.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Moderation features</span></dt><dd><p>To "moderate" is to check posts to make sure they are
            a) not spam, and b) on topic, before
            they go out to the entire list.  Moderation necessarily
            involves humans, but software can do a lot to make it
            easier.  There is more said about moderation
            later.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Administrative interface</span></dt><dd><p>Among other things, this enables an administrator to go in
            and remove obsolete addresses easily.  This can become
            urgent when a recipient's address starts sending automatic
            "I am no longer at this address" replies back to the list
            in response to every list post.  (Some mailing list
            software can even detect this by itself and unsubscribe
            the person automatically.)</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Header manipulation</span></dt><dd><p>Many people have sophisticated filtering and replying
            rules set up in their mail readers.  Mailing list software
            can add and manipulate certain standard headers for these
            people to take advantage of (more details below).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Archiving</span></dt><dd><p>All posts to the managed lists are stored and made
            available on the web; alternatively, some mailing list
            software offers special interfaces for plugging in an
            external archiving tool such as MHonArc
            (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mhonarc.org/">http://www.mhonarc.org/</a>).  As

            discusses, archiving is crucial.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The point of all this is merely to emphasize that mailing list
management is a complex problem that has been given a lot of thought,
and mostly been solved.  You certainly don't need to become an expert
in it.  But you should be aware that there's always room to learn
more, and that list management will occupy your attention from time to
time in the course of running a free software project.  Below we'll
examine a few of the most common mailing list configuration
issues.</p><div class="sect2" title="Spam Prevention"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="spam-prevention"/>Spam Prevention</h2></div></div></div><p>Between when this sentence is written and when it is published,
the Internet-wide spam problem will probably double in
severity—or at least it will feel that way.  There was a time,
not so long ago, when one could run a mailing list without taking any
spam-prevention measures at all.  The occasional stray post would
still show up, but infrequently enough to be only a low-level
annoyance.  That era is gone forever.  Today, a mailing list that
takes no spam prevention measures will quickly be submerged in junk
emails, to the point of unusability.  Spam prevention is
mandatory.</p><p>We divide spam prevention into two categories: preventing spam
posts from appearing on your mailing lists, and preventing your
mailing list from being a source of new email addresses for spammers'
harvesters.  The former is more important, so we examine it
first.</p><div class="sect3" title="Filtering posts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="spam-filtering"/>Filtering posts</h3></div></div></div><p>There are three basic techniques for preventing spam posts, and
most mailing list software offers all three.  They are best used in
tandem:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Only auto-allow postings from
            list subscribers.</strong></span></p><p>This is effective as far as it goes, and also
            involves very little administrative overhead, since it's
            usually just a matter of changing a setting in the mailing
            list software's configuration.  But note that posts which
            aren't automatically approved must not be simply
            discarded.  Instead, they should be passed along for
            moderation, for two reasons.  First, you want to allow
            non-subscribers to post.  A person with a question or
            suggestion should not need to subscribe to a mailing list
            just to make a single post there.  Second, even
            subscribers may sometimes post from an address other than
            the one by which they're subscribed.  Email addresses are
            not a reliable method of identifying people, and shouldn't
            be treated as such.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Filter posts through
            spam-filtering software.</strong></span></p><p>If the mailing list software makes it possible (most
            do), you can have posts filtered by spam-filtering
            software.  Automatic spam-filtering is not perfect, and
            never will be, since there is a never-ending arms race
            between spammers and filter writers.  However, it can
            greatly reduce the amount of spam that gets through to the
            moderation queue, and since the longer that queue is the
            more time humans must spend examining it, any amount of
            automated filtering is beneficial.</p><p>There is not space here for detailed instructions
            on setting up spam filters.  You will have to consult
            your mailing list software's documentation for that (see
            <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#mailing-list-software" title="Software">the section called “Software”</a><span> later in this chapter</span>).  List
            software often comes with some built-in spam prevention
            features, but you may want to add some third-party
            filters.  I've had good experiences with these two:
            SpamAssassin
            (<a class="ulink" href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">http://spamassassin.apache.org/</a>)
            and SpamProbe
            (<a class="ulink" href="http://spamprobe.sourceforge.net/">http://spamprobe.sourceforge.net/</a>).  This
            is not a comment on the many other open source spam
            filters out there, some of which are apparently also quite
            good.  I just happen to have used those two myself and
            been satisfied with them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Moderation.</strong></span></p><p>For mails that aren't automatically allowed by
            virtue of being from a list subscriber, and which make it
            through the spam filtering software, if any, the last stage
            is <em class="firstterm">moderation</em>: the mail is routed
            to a special address, where a human examines it and
            confirms or rejects it.</p><p>Confirming a post takes one of two forms: you can
            accept the post just this once, or you can tell the list
            software to allow this and all future posts from the same
            sender.  You almost always want to do the latter, in order
            to reduce the future moderation burden.  Details on how
            to confirm vary from system to system, but it's usually a
            matter of replying to a special address with the command
            "accept" (meaning accept just this one post) or "allow"
            (allow this and future posts).</p><p>Rejecting is usually done by simply ignoring the
            moderation mail.  If the list software never receives
            confirmation that something is a valid post, then it won't
            pass that post on to the list, so simply dropping the
            moderation mail achieves the desired effect.  Sometimes
            you also have the option of responding with a "reject" or
            "deny" command, to automatically disapprove future mails
            from the same sender without even running them through
            moderation.  There is rarely any point doing this, since
            moderation is mostly about spam prevention, and spammers
            tend not to send from the same address twice anyway.</p></li></ol></div><p>Be sure to use moderation <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for
filtering out spams and clearly off-topic messages, such as when
someone accidentally posts to the wrong mailing list.  The moderation
system will usually give you a way to respond directly to the sender,
but don't use that method to answer questions that really belong on
the mailing list itself, even if you know the answer off the top of
your head.  To do so would deprive the project's community of an
accurate picture of what sorts of questions people are asking, and
deprive them of a chance to answer questions themselves and/or see
answers from others.  Mailing list moderation is strictly about
keeping the list free of junk and off-topic emails, nothing
more.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Address hiding in archives"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="address-hiding"/>Address hiding in archives</h3></div></div></div><p>To prevent your mailing lists from being a source of addresses
for spammers, a common technique is for the archives to obscure
people's email addresses, for example by replacing</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><code class="literal">jrandom@somedomain.com</code></p></blockquote></div><p>with</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><code class="literal">jrandom_AT_somedomain.com</code></p></blockquote></div><p>or</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><code class="literal">jrandomNOSPAM@somedomain.com</code></p></blockquote></div><p>or some similarly obvious (to a human) encoding.  Since spam
address harvesters often work by crawling through web
pages—including your mailing list's online archives—and
looking for sequences containing "@", encoding the addresses is a way
of making people's email addresses invisible or useless to spammers.
This does nothing to prevent spam from being sent to the mailing list
itself, of course, but it does avoid increasing the amount of spam
sent directly to list users' personal addresses.</p><p>Address hiding can be controversial.  Some people like it a lot,
and will be surprised if your archives don't do it automatically.
Other people think it's too much of an inconvenience (because humans
also have to translate the addresses back before using them).
Sometimes people assert that it's ineffective, because a harvester
could in theory compensate for any consistent encoding pattern.
However, note that there is empirical evidence that address hiding
<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> effective, see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml">http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml</a>.</p><p>Ideally, the list management software would leave the choice up
to each individual subscriber, either through a special yes/no header
or a setting in that subscriber's list account preferences.  However,
I don't know of any software which offers per-subscriber or per-post
choice in the matter, so for now the list manager must make a decision
for everyone (assuming the archiver offers the feature at all, which
is not always the case).  I lean very mildly toward turning
address hiding on.  Some people are very careful to avoid posting
their email addresses on web pages or anywhere else a spam harvester
might see it, and they would be disappointed to have all that care
thrown away by a mailing list archive; meanwhile, the inconvenience
address hiding imposes on archive users is very slight, since it's
trivial to transform an obscured address back to a valid one if you
need to reach the person.  But keep in mind that, in the end, it's
still an arms race: by the time you read this, harvesters might well
have evolved to the point where they can recognize most common forms
of hiding, and we'll have to think of something else.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Identification and Header Management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="header-management"/>Identification and Header Management</h2></div></div></div><p>List subscribers often want to put mails from the list into a
project-specific folder, separate from their other mail.  Their
mail reading software can do this automatically by examining the mail's
<em class="firstterm">headers</em>.  The headers are the fields at the top
of the mail that indicate the sender, recipient, subject, date, and
various other things about the message.  Certain headers are
well known and effectively mandatory:</p><pre class="screen">
From: ...
To: ...
Subject: ...
Date: ...
</pre><p>Others are optional, though still quite standard.  For example,
emails are not strictly required to have the</p><pre class="screen">
Reply-to: sender@email.address.here
</pre><p>header, but most do, because it gives recipients a foolproof way
to reach the author (it is especially useful when the author had to
send from an address other than the one to which replies should be
directed).</p><p>Some mail reading software offers an easy-to-use interface for
filing mails based on patterns in the Subject header.  This leads
people to request that the mailing list add an automatic prefix to all
Subjects, so they can set their readers to look for that prefix and
automatically file the mails in the right folder.  The idea is that
the original author would write:</p><pre class="screen">
Subject: Making the 2.5 release.
</pre><p>but the mail would show up on the list looking like this:</p><pre class="screen">
Subject: [discuss@lists.example.org] Making the 2.5 release.
</pre><p>Although most list management software offers the option to do
this, I strongly recommend against turning the option on.  The problem
it solves can easily be solved in much less obtrusive ways, and the
cost of eating space in the Subject field is far too high.
Experienced mailing list users typically scan the Subjects of the
day's incoming list mail to decide what to read and/or respond to.
Prepending the list's name to the Subject can push the right side of
the Subject off the screen, rendering it invisible.  This obscures
information that people depend on to decide what mails to open, thus
reducing the overall functionality of the mailing list for
everyone.</p><p>Instead of munging the Subject header, teach your users to take
advantage of the other standard headers, starting with the To header,
which should say the mailing list's name:</p><pre class="screen">
To: &lt;discuss@lists.example.org&gt;
</pre><p>Any mail reader that can filter on Subject should be able to filter on
To just as easily.</p><p>There are a few other optional-but-standard headers expected for
mailing lists.  Filtering on these is even more reliable than using
the "To" or "Cc" headers; since these headers are added to each post
by the mailing list management software itself, some users may be
counting on their presence:</p><pre class="screen">
list-help: &lt;mailto:discuss-help@lists.example.org&gt;
list-unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:discuss-unsubscribe@lists.example.org&gt;
list-post: &lt;mailto:discuss@lists.example.org&gt;
Delivered-To: mailing list discuss@lists.example.org
Mailing-List: contact discuss-help@lists.example.org; run by ezmlm
</pre><p>For the most part, they are self-explanatory.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nisto.com/listspec/list-manager-intro.html">http://www.nisto.com/listspec/list-manager-intro.html</a> for more
explanation, or if you need the really detailed, formal specification,
see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2369.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2369.html</a>.
</p><p>Notice how these headers imply that if you have a mailing list
named "list", then you also have administrative addresses "list-help"
and "list-unsubscribe" available.  In addition to these, it is normal
to have "list-subscribe", for joining, and "list-owner", for reaching
the list administrators.  Depending on the list management software
you use, these and/or various other administrative addresses may be
set up; the documentation will have details.  Usually a complete
explanation of all these special addresses is mailed to each new user
as part of an automated "welcome mail" on subscribing.  You yourself
will probably get a copy of this welcome mail.  If you don't, then ask
someone else for a copy, so you know what your users are seeing when
they join the list.  Keep the copy handy so you can answer questions
about the mailing list functions, or better yet, put it on a web page
somewhere.  That way when people lose their own copy of the
instructions and post to ask "How do I unsubscribe from this list?",
you can just hand them the URL.</p><p>Some mailing list software offers an option to append
unsubscription instructions to the bottom of every post.  If that
option is available, turn it on.  It causes only a couple of extra
lines per message, in a harmless location, and it can save you a lot
of time, by cutting down on the number of people who mail you—or
worse, mail the list!—asking how to unsubscribe.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Great Reply-to Debate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="reply-to"/>The Great Reply-to Debate</h2></div></div></div><p>Earlier, in <a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#avoid-private-discussions" title="Avoid Private Discussions">the section called “Avoid Private Discussions”</a>, I stressed the
importance of making sure discussions stay in public forums, and
talked about how active measures are sometimes needed to prevent
conversations from trailing off into private email threads;
furthermore, this chapter is all about setting up project
communications software to do as much of the work for you as possible.
Therefore, if the mailing list management software offers a way to
automatically cause discussions to stay on the list, you would think
turning that feature on would be the obvious choice.</p><p>Well, not quite.  There is such a feature, but it has some
pretty severe disadvantages.  The question of whether or not to use it
is one of the hottest debates in mailing list
management—admittedly, not a controversy that's likely to make
the evening news in your city, but it can flare up from time to time
in free software projects.  Below, I will describe the feature, give
the major arguments on both sides, and make the best recommendation I
can.</p><p>The feature itself is very simple: the mailing list software
can, if you wish, automatically set the Reply-to header on every post
to redirect replies to the mailing list.  That is, no matter what the
original sender puts in the Reply-to header (or even if they don't
include one at all), by the time the list subscribers see the post,
the header will contain the list address:</p><pre class="screen">
Reply-to: discuss@lists.example.org
</pre><p>On its face, this seems like a good thing.  Because virtually
all mail reading software pays attention to the Reply-to header, now
when anyone responds to a post, their response will be automatically
addressed to the entire list, not just to the sender of the message
being responded to.  Of course, the responder can still manually
change where the message goes, but the important thing is that
<span class="emphasis"><em>by default</em></span> replies are directed to the list.
It's a perfect example of using technology to encourage
collaboration.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages.  The first is known
as the <em class="firstterm">Can't Find My Way Back Home</em> problem:
sometimes the original sender will put their "real" email address in
the Reply-to field, because for one reason or another they send email
from a different address than where they receive it.  People who
always read and send from the same location don't have this problem,
and may be surprised that it even exists.  But for those who have
unusual email configurations, or who cannot control how the From
address on their mails looks (perhaps because they send from work and
do not have any influence over the IT department), using Reply-to may
be the only way they have to ensure that responses reach them.  When
such a person posts to a mailing list that he's not subscribed to, his
setting of Reply-to becomes essential information.  If the list
software overwrites it, he may never see the responses to his post.</p><p>The second disadvantage has to do with expectations, and in my
opinion is the most powerful argument against Reply-to munging.  Most
experienced mail users are accustomed to two basic methods of
replying: <em class="firstterm">reply-to-all</em> and
<em class="firstterm">reply-to-author</em>.  All modern mail reading
software has separate keys for these two actions.  Users know that to
reply to everyone (that is, including the list), they should choose
reply-to-all, and to reply privately to the author, they should choose
reply-to-author.  Although you want to encourage people to reply to
the list whenever possible, there are certainly circumstances where a
private reply is the responder's prerogative—for example, they
may want to say something confidential to the author of the original
message, something that would be inappropriate on the public
list.</p><p>Now consider what happens when the list has overridden the
original sender's Reply-to.  The responder hits the reply-to-author
key, expecting to send a private message back to the original author.
Because that's the expected behavior, he may not bother to look
carefully at the recipient address in the new message.  He composes
his private, confidential message, one which perhaps says embarrassing
things about someone on the list, and hits the send key.
Unexpectedly, a few minutes later his message appears <span class="emphasis"><em>on the
mailing list!</em></span> True, in theory he should have looked
carefully at the recipient field, and should not have assumed anything
about the Reply-to header.  But authors almost always set Reply-to to
their own personal address (or rather, their mail software sets it for
them), and many longtime email users have come to expect that.  In
fact, when a person deliberately sets Reply-to to some other address,
such as the list, he usually makes a point of mentioning this in the
body of the message, so people won't be surprised at what happens when
they reply.</p><p>Because of the possibly severe consequences of this unexpected
behavior, my own preference is to configure list management software
to never touch the Reply-to header.  This is one instance where using
technology to encourage collaboration has, it seems to me, potentially
dangerous side-effects.  However, there are also some powerful
arguments on the other side of this debate.  Whichever way you choose,
you will occasionally get people posting to your list asking why you
didn't choose the other way.  Since this is not something you ever
want as the main topic of discussion on your list, it might be good to
have a canned response ready, of the sort that's more likely to stop
discussion than encourage it.  Make sure you do
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> insist that your decision, whichever it is,
is obviously the only right and sensible one (even if you think that's
the case).  Instead, point out that this is a very old debate, there
are good arguments on both sides, no choice is going to satisfy
all users, and therefore you just made the best decision you
could.  Politely ask that the subject not be revisited unless someone
has something genuinely new to say, then stay out of the thread and
hope it dies a natural death.</p><p>Someone may suggest a vote to choose one way or the other.  You
can do that if you want, but I personally do not feel that counting
heads is a satisfactory solution in this case.  The penalty for
someone who is surprised by the behavior is so huge (accidentally
sending a private mail to a public list), and the inconvenience for
everyone else is fairly slight (occasionally having to remind someone
to respond to the whole list instead of just to you), that it's not
clear that the majority, even though they are the majority, should be
able to put the minority at such risk.</p><p>I have not addressed all aspects of this issue here, just the
ones that seemed of overriding importance.  For a full discussion, see
these two canonical documents, which are the ones people always cite
when they're having this debate:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Leave Reply-to alone</strong></span>,

is a "right" answer to this question, and happily participate in many
lists that <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> set Reply-to.  The most important
thing you can do is settle on one way or the other early, and try not
to get entangled in debates about it after that.</p><div class="sect3" title="Two fantasies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="reply-fantasies"/>Two fantasies</h3></div></div></div><p>Someday, someone will get the bright idea to implement a
<em class="firstterm">reply-to-list</em> key in a mail reader.  It would
use some of the custom list headers mentioned earlier to figure out
the address of the mailing list, and then address the reply directly
to the list only, leaving off any other recipient addresses, since
most are probably subscribed to the list anyway.  Eventually, other
mail readers will pick up the feature, and this whole debate will go
away.  (Actually, the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a>
mail reader does offer this feature.<sup>[<a id="idp5635840" href="#ftn.idp5635840" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup>)</p><p>An even better solution would be for Reply-to munging to be a
per-subscriber preference.  Those who want the list to set Reply-to
munged (either on others' posts or on their own posts) could ask for
that, and those who don't would ask for Reply-to to be left alone.
However, I don't know of any list management software that offers this
on a per-subscriber basis.  For now, we seem to be stuck with a global
setting.<sup>[<a id="idp5638000" href="#ftn.idp5638000" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Archiving"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="archiving"/>Archiving</h2></div></div></div><p>The technical details of setting up mailing list archiving are
specific to the software that's running the list, and are beyond the
scope of this book.  When choosing or configuring an archiver,
consider these qualities:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Prompt updating</span></dt><dd><p>People will often want to refer to an archived post made
            within the last hour or two.  If possible, the archiver
            should archive each post instantaneously, so that by the
            time a post appears on the mailing list, it's already
            present in the archives.  If that option isn't available,
            then at least try to set the archiver to update itself
            every hour or so.  (By default, some archivers run their
            update processes once per night, but in practice that's
            far too much lag time for an active mailing list.)</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Referential stability</span></dt><dd><p>Once a message is archived at a particular URL, it should
            remain accessible at that exact same URL forever, or as
            close to forever as possible.  Even if the archives are
            rebuilt, restored from backup, or otherwise fixed, any
            URLs that have already been made publicly available
            should remain the same.  Stable references make it
            possible for Internet search engines to index the
            archives, which is a major boon to users looking for
            answers.  Stable references are also important because
            mailing list posts and threads are often linked to from
            the bug tracker (see
            <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html" title="Bug Tracker">the section called “Bug Tracker”</a><span>
            later in this chapter</span>) or
            from other project documents.</p><p>Ideally, mailing list software would include a message's
            archive URL, or at least the message-specific portion of
            the URL, in a header when it distributes the message to
            recipients.  That way people who have a copy of the
            message would be able to know its archive location
            without having to actually visit the archives, which would
            be helpful because any operation that involves one's web
            browser is automatically time-consuming.  Whether any
            mailing list software actually offers this feature, I don't
            know; unfortunately, the ones I have used do not.
            However, it's something to look for (or, if you write
            mailing list software, it's a feature to consider
            implementing, please).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Backups</span></dt><dd><p>It should be reasonably obvious how to back up the
            archives, and the restoration recipe should not be too
            difficult.  In other words, don't treat your archiver as a
            black box.  You (or someone in your project) should know
            where it's storing the messages, and how to regenerate the
            actual archive pages from the message store if it should
            ever become necessary.  Those archives are precious
            data—a project that loses them loses a good part of
            its collective memory.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Thread support</span></dt><dd><p>It should be possible to go from any individual message to
            the <em class="firstterm">thread</em> (group of related
            messages) that the original message is part of.  Each
            thread should have its own URL too, separate from the URLs
            of the individual messages in the thread.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Searchability</span></dt><dd><p>An archiver that doesn't support searching—on the
            bodies of messages, as well as on authors and
            subjects—is close to useless.  Note that some archivers 
            support searching by simply farming the work out to an
            external search engine such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.  This is
            acceptable, but direct search support is usually more
            fine-tuned, because it allows the searcher to specify that
            the match must appear in a subject line versus the body,
            for example.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The above is just a technical checklist to help you evaluate and
