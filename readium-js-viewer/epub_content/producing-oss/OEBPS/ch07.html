release their software, and how overall development patterns organize
around those goals.</p><p>A major difference between open source projects and proprietary
ones is the lack of centralized control over the development team.
When a new release is being prepared, this difference is especially
stark: a corporation can ask its entire development team to focus on
an upcoming release, putting aside new feature development and
non-critical bug fixing until the release is done.  Volunteer groups
are not so monolithic.  People work on the project for all sorts of
reasons, and those not interested in helping with a given release
still want to continue regular development work while the release is
going on.  Because development doesn't stop, open source release
processes tend to take longer, but be less disruptive, than commercial
release processes.  It's a bit like highway repair.  There are two
ways to fix a road: you can shut it down completely, so that a repair
crew can swarm all over it at full capacity until the problem is
solved, or you can work on a couple of lanes at a time, while leaving the
others open to traffic.  The first way is very efficient <span class="emphasis"><em>for
the repair crew</em></span>, but not for anyone else—the road is
entirely shut down until the job is done.  The second way involves
much more time and trouble for the repair crew (now they have to work
with fewer people and less equipment, in cramped conditions, with
flaggers to slow and direct traffic, etc.), but at least the road
remains useable, albeit not at full capacity.</p><p>Open source projects tend to work the second way.  In fact, for
a mature piece of software with several different release lines being
maintained simultaneously, the project is sort of in a permanent state
of minor road repair.  There are always a couple of lanes closed; a
consistent but low level of background inconvenience is always being
tolerated by the development group as a whole, so that releases get
made on a regular schedule.</p><p>The model that makes this possible generalizes to more than just
releases.  It's the principle of parallelizing tasks that are not
mutually interdependent—a principle that is by no means unique
to open source development, of course, but one which open source
projects implement in their own particular way.  They cannot afford to
annoy either the roadwork crew or the regular traffic too much, but
they also cannot afford to have people dedicated to standing by the
orange cones and flagging traffic along.  Thus they gravitate toward
processes that have flat, constant levels of administrative overhead,
rather than peaks and valleys.  Volunteers are generally willing to
work with small but consistent amounts of inconvenience; the
predictability allows them to come and go without worrying about
whether their schedule will clash with what's happening in the
project.  But if the project were subject to a master schedule in
which some activities excluded other activities, the result would be a
lot of developers sitting idle a lot of the time—which would be
not only inefficient but boring, and therefore dangerous, in that a
bored developer is likely to soon be an ex-developer.</p><p>Release work is usually the most noticeable non-development task
that happens in parallel with development, so the methods described in
the following sections are geared mostly toward enabling releases.
However, note that they also apply to other parallelizable tasks, such
as translations and internationalization, broad API changes made
gradually across the entire code base, etc.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Release Numbering"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="release-numbering"/>Release Numbering</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we talk about how to make a release, let's look at how to
name releases, which requires knowing what releases actually mean to
users.  A release means that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Old bugs have been fixed.  This is probably the one
            thing users can count on being true of every release.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>New bugs have been added.  This too can usually
            be counted on, except sometimes in the case of security
            releases or other one-offs (see
            <a class="xref" href="ch07s06.html#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called “Security Releases”</a><span> later in this chapter</span>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>New features may have been added.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>New configuration options may have been added, or
            the meanings of old options may have changed subtly.  The
            installation procedures may have changed slightly since
            the last release too, though one always hopes not.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Incompatible changes may have been introduced, such
            that the data formats used by older versions of the
            software are no longer useable without undergoing some
            sort of (possibly manual) one-way conversion step.</p></li></ul></div><p>As you can see, not all of these are good things.  This is why
experienced users approach new releases with some trepidation,
especially when the software is mature and was already mostly doing
what they wanted (or thought they wanted).  Even the arrival of new
features is a mixed blessing, in that it may mean the software
will now behave in unexpected ways.</p><p>The purpose of release numbering, therefore, is twofold:
obviously the numbers should unambiguously communicate the ordering of
releases (i.e., by looking at any two releases' numbers, one can know
which came later), but also they should indicate as compactly as
possible the degree and nature of the changes in the release.</p><p>All that in a number?  Well, more or less, yes.  Release
numbering strategies are one of the oldest bikeshed discussions around
(see <a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">the section called “The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span>), and the world is
unlikely to settle on a single, complete standard anytime soon.
However, a few good strategies have emerged, along with one
universally agreed-on principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>be consistent</em></span>.
Pick a numbering scheme, document it, and stick with it.  Your users
will thank you.</p><div class="sect2" title="Release Number Components"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="release-number-components"/>Release Number Components</h2></div></div></div><p>This section describes the formal conventions of release
numbering in detail, and assumes very little prior knowledge.  It is
intended mainly as a reference.  If you're already familiar with these
conventions, you can skip this section.</p><p>Release numbers are groups of digits separated by dots:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley 2.3<br/>
Singer 5.11.4</p></div></div><p>...and so on.  The dots are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> decimal
points, they are merely separators; "5.3.9" would be followed by
"5.3.10".  A few projects have occasionally hinted otherwise, most
famously the Linux kernel with its "0.95", "0.96"... "0.99" sequence
leading up to Linux 1.0, but the convention that the dots are not
decimals is now firmly established and should be considered a
standard.  There is no limit to the number of components (digit
portions containing no dots), but most projects do not go beyond three
or four.  The reasons why will become clear later.</p><p>In addition to the numeric components, projects sometimes tack
on a descriptive label such as "Alpha" or "Beta" (see
<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#alpha-and-beta" title="Alpha and Beta">Alpha and Beta</a>), for example:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley 2.3.0 (Alpha)<br/>
Singer 5.11.4 (Beta)</p></div></div><p>An Alpha or Beta qualifier means that this
release <span class="emphasis"><em>precedes</em></span> a future release that will have
the same number without the qualifier.  Thus, "2.3.0 (Alpha)"
leads eventually to "2.3.0".  In order to allow several such candidate
releases in a row, the qualifiers themselves can have meta-qualifiers.
For example, here is a series of releases in the order that they would
be made available to the public:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley 2.3.0 (Alpha 1)<br/>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Alpha 2)<br/>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 1)<br/>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 2)<br/>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 3)<br/>
Scanley 2.3.0</p></div></div><p>Notice that when it has the "Alpha" qualifier, Scanley "2.3" is
written as "2.3.0".  The two numbers are equivalent—trailing
all-zero components can always be dropped for brevity—but when a
qualifier is present, brevity is out the window anyway, so one might
as well go for completeness instead.</p><p>Other qualifiers in semi-regular use include "Stable",
"Unstable", "Development", and "RC" (for "Release Candidate").  The
most widely used ones are still "Alpha" and "Beta", with "RC" running
a close third place, but note that "RC" always includes a numeric
meta-qualifier.  That is, you don't release
"Scanley 2.3.0 (RC)", you release
"Scanley 2.3.0 (RC 1)", followed by RC2, etc.</p><p>Those three labels, "Alpha", "Beta", and "RC", are pretty widely
known now, and I don't recommend using any of the others, even though
the others might at first glance seem like better choices because they
are normal words, not jargon.  But people who install software from
releases are already familiar with the big three, and there's no
reason to do things gratuitously differently from the way everyone
else does them.</p><p>Although the dots in release numbers are not decimal points,
they do indicate place-value significance.  All "0.X.Y" releases
precede "1.0" (which is equivalent to "1.0.0", of course).  "3.14.158"
immediately precedes "3.14.159", and non-immediately precedes
"3.14.160" as well as "3.15.anything", and so.</p><p>A consistent release numbering policy enables a user to look at
two release numbers for the same piece of software and tell, just from
the numbers, the important differences between those two releases.  In
a typical three-component system, the first component is
the <em class="firstterm">major number</em>, the second is
the <em class="firstterm">minor number</em>, and the third is the
<em class="firstterm">micro number</em>.  For example, release
"2.10.17" is the seventeenth micro release in the tenth minor release
line within the second major release series.  The words "line" and
"series" are used informally here, but they mean what one would
expect.  A major series is simply all the releases that share the same
major number, and a minor series (or minor line) consists of all the releases
that share the same minor <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> major number.  That
is, "2.4.0" and "3.4.1" are not in the same minor series,
even though they both have "4" for their minor number; on the other
hand, "2.4.0" and "2.4.2" are in the same minor line, though they are
not adjacent if "2.4.1" was released between them.</p><p>The meanings of these numbers are exactly what you'd expect: an
increment of the major number indicates that major changes happened;
an increment of the minor number indicates minor changes; and an
increment of the micro number indicates really trivial changes.  Some
projects add a fourth component, usually called
the <em class="firstterm">patch number</em>, for especially
fine-grained control over the differences between their releases
(confusingly, other projects use "patch" as a synonym for "micro" in a
three-component system).  There are also projects that use the last
component as a <em class="firstterm">build number</em>, incremented
every time the software is built and representing no change other than
that build.  This helps the project link every bug report with a
specific build, and is probably most useful when binary packages are
the default method of distribution.</p><p>Although there are many different conventions for how many
components to use, and what the components mean, the differences tend
to be minor—you get a little leeway, but not a lot.  The next
two sections discuss some of the most widely used conventions.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Simple Strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="release-number-simple-strategy"/>The Simple Strategy</h2></div></div></div><p>Most projects have rules about what kinds of changes are allowed
into a release if one is only incrementing the micro number, different
rules for the minor number, and still different ones for the major
number.  There is no set standard for these rules yet, but here I will
describe a policy that has been used successfully by multiple
projects.  You may want to just adopt this policy in your own
project, but even if you don't, it's still a good example of the kind
of information release numbers should convey.  This policy is adapted
from the numbering system used by the APR project, see
<a class="ulink" href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html">http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html</a>.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Changes to the micro number only (that is, changes
            within the same minor line) must be both forward- and
            backward-compatible.  That is, the changes should be bug
            fixes only, or very small enhancements to existing
            features.  New features should not be introduced in a
            micro release.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Changes to the minor number (that is, within the
            same major line) must be backward-compatible, but not
            necessarily forward-compatible.  It's normal to introduce
            new features in a minor release, but usually not too many
            new features at once.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Changes to the major number mark compatibility
            boundaries.  A new major release can be forward- and
            backward-incompatible.  A major release is expected to
            have new features, and may even have entire new feature
            sets.</p></li></ol></div><p>What <em class="firstterm">backward-compatible</em>
and <em class="firstterm">forward-compatible</em> mean, exactly, depends on
what your software does, but in context they are usually not open to
much interpretation.  For example, if your project is a client/server
application, then "backward-compatible" means that upgrading the
server to 2.6.0 should not cause any existing 2.5.4 clients to lose
functionality or behave differently than they did before (except for
bugs that were fixed, of course).  On the other hand, upgrading one of
those clients to 2.6.0, along with the server, might
make <span class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> functionality available for that client,
functionality that 2.5.4 clients don't know how to take advantage of.
If that happens, then the upgrade is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
"forward-compatible": clearly you can't now downgrade that client
back to 2.5.4 and keep all the functionality it had at 2.6.0, since
some of that functionality was new in 2.6.0.</p><p>This is why micro releases are essentially for bug fixes only.
They must remain compatible in both directions: if you upgrade from
2.5.3 to 2.5.4, then change your mind and downgrade back to 2.5.3, no
functionality should be lost.  Of course, the bugs fixed in 2.5.4
would reappear after the downgrade, but you wouldn't lose any
features, except insofar as the restored bugs prevent the use of some
existing features.</p><p>Client/server protocols are just one of many possible
compatibility domains.  Another is data formats: does the software
write data to permanent storage?  If so, the formats it reads and
writes need to follow the compatibility guidelines promised by the
release number policy.  Version 2.6.0 needs to be able to read the
files written by 2.5.4, but may silently upgrade the format to
something that 2.5.4 cannot read, because the ability to downgrade is
not required across a minor number boundary.  If your project
distributes code libraries for other programs to use, then APIs are a
compatibility domain too: you must make sure that source and binary
compatibility rules are spelled out in such a way that the informed
user need never wonder whether or not it's safe to upgrade in place.
She will be able to look at the numbers and know instantly.</p><p>In this system, you don't get a chance for a fresh start until
you increment the major number.  This can often be a real
inconvenience: there may be features you wish to add, or protocols
that you wish to redesign, that simply cannot be done while
maintaining compatibility.  There's no magic solution to this, except
to try to design things in an extensible way in the first place (a
topic easily worth its own book, and certainly outside the scope of
this one).  But publishing a release compatibility policy, and
adhering to it, is an inescapable part of distributing software.  One
nasty surprise can alienate a lot of users.  The policy just described
is good partly because it's already quite widespread, but also because
it's easy to explain and to remember, even for those not already familiar
with it.</p><p>It is generally understood that these rules do not apply to
pre-1.0 releases (although your release policy should probably state
so explicitly, just to be clear).  A project that is still in initial
development can release 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and so on in sequence, until
it's ready for 1.0, and the differences between those releases can be
arbitrarily large.  Micro numbers in pre-1.0 releases are optional.
Depending on the nature of your project and the differences between
the releases, you might find it useful to have 0.1.0, 0.1.1, etc., or
you might not.  Conventions for pre-1.0 release numbers are fairly
loose, mainly because people understand that strong compatibility
constraints would hamper early development too much, and because early
adopters tend to be forgiving anyway.</p><p>Remember that all these injunctions only apply to this
particular three-component system.  Your project could easily come up
with a different three-component system, or even decide it doesn't
need such fine granularity and use a two-component system instead.
The important thing is to decide early, publish exactly what the
components mean, and stick to it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Even/Odd Strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="release-number-even-odd-strategy"/>The Even/Odd Strategy</h2></div></div></div><p>Some projects use the parity of the minor number component to
indicate the stability of the software: even means stable, odd means
unstable.  This applies only to the minor number, not the major and
micro numbers.  Increments in the micro number still indicate bug
fixes (no new features), and increments in the major number still
indicate big changes, new feature sets, etc.</p><p>The advantage of the even/odd system, which has been used by the
Linux kernel project among others, is that it offers a way to release
new functionality for testing without subjecting production users to
potentially unstable code.  People can see from the numbers that
"2.4.21" is okay to install on their live web server, but that "2.5.1"
should probably stay confined to home workstation experiments.  The
development team handles the bug reports that come in from the
unstable (odd-minor-numbered) series, and when things start to settle
down after some number of micro releases in that series, they
increment the minor number (thus making it even), reset the micro
number back to "0", and release a presumably stable package.</p><p>This system preserves, or at least, does not conflict with, the
compatibility guidelines given earlier.  It simply overloads the minor
number with some extra information.  This forces the minor number to
be incremented about twice as often as would otherwise be necessary,
but there's no great harm in that.  The even/odd system is probably
best for projects that have very long release cycles, and which by
their nature have a high proportion of conservative users who value
stability above new features.  It is not the only way to get new
functionality tested in the wild, however.
<a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html" title="Stabilizing a Release">the section called “Stabilizing a Release”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span> describes another, perhaps more common,
method of releasing potentially unstable code to the public, marked so
that people have an idea of the risk/benefit trade-offs immediately on
seeing the release's name.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
