<p class="lead">A <b>tropical cyclone</b> is a storm system fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and the water vapor
in it condenses. The term describes the storm's origin in the tropics and its cyclonic nature, which means that
its circulation is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Tropical
cyclones are distinguished from other cyclonic windstorms such as nor'easters, European windstorms, and polar
lows by the heat mechanism that fuels them, which makes them "warm core" storm systems.</p>
<p class="cont">Depending on their location and strength, there are various terms by which tropical cyclones are known,
such as <b>hurricane</b>, <b>typhoon</b>, <b>tropical storm</b>, <b>cyclonic storm</b> and <b>tropical depression.</b></p>
<p class="cont">Tropical cyclones can produce extremely strong winds, tornadoes, torrential rain, high waves,
and storm surges. The heavy rains and storm surges can produce extensive flooding. Although their
effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones also can have beneficial
effects by relieving drought conditions. They carry heat away from the tropics, an important mechanism
of the global atmospheric circulation that maintains equilibrium in the earth's troposphere.</p>
<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics of tropical cyclones</h2>
<div class="ibox_wr">
<img class="ipic" src="Hurricane_profile_graphic.svg" alt="Tropical cyclone formation diagram"/>
<p class="icap">Tropical cyclones form when the energy released by the condensation of moisture in rising
air causes a positive feedback loop over warm ocean waters.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Structurally, a tropical cyclone is a large, rotating system of clouds, wind, and thunderstorms. Its primary
energy source is the release of the heat of condensation from water vapor condensing at high altitudes, the heat
being ultimately derived from the sun. Therefore, a tropical cyclone can be thought of as a giant vertical
heat engine supported by mechanics driven by physical forces such as the rotation and gravity of the Earth.
In another way, tropical cyclones could be viewed as a special type of Mesoscale Convective Complex, which
continues to develop over a vast source of relative warmth and moisture. Condensation leads to higher wind speeds,
as a tiny fraction of the released energy is converted into mechanical energy; the faster winds and lower pressure
associated with them in turn cause increased surface evaporation and thus even more condensation. Much of the
released energy drives updrafts that increase the height of the storm clouds, speeding up condensation.
This gives rise to factors that provide the system with enough energy to be self-sufficient and cause
a positive feedback loop, where it can draw more energy as long as the source of heat, warm water, remains.
Factors such as a continued lack of equilibrium in air mass distribution would also give supporting energy
to the cyclone. The rotation of the earth causes the system to spin, an effect known as the Coriolis effect,
giving it a cyclonic characteristic and affecting the trajectory of the storm.</p>
<p class="cont">The factors to form a tropical cyclone include a pre-existing weather disturbance, warm tropical oceans,
moisture, and relatively light winds aloft. If the right conditions persist and allow it to create a feedback
loop by maximizing the energy intake possible – for example, such as high winds to increase the rate of
evaporation – they can combine to produce the violent winds, incredible waves, torrential rains, and floods
associated with this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="cont">Condensation as a driving force is what primarily distinguishes tropical cyclones from other meteorological
phenomena. Because this is strongest in a tropical climate, this defines the initial domain of the tropical cyclone.
By contrast, mid-latitude cyclones draw their energy mostly from pre-existing horizontal temperature gradients in the
atmosphere. To continue to drive its heat engine, a tropical cyclone must remain over warm water, which provides
the needed atmospheric moisture. The evaporation of this moisture is accelerated by the high winds and reduced
atmospheric pressure in the storm, resulting in a positive feedback loop. As a result, when a tropical cyclone
passes over land, its strength diminishes rapidly.</p>
<div class="ibox_l" style="max-width:783px">
<img class="ipic" src="783px-GulfMexTemps_2005Hurricanes.gif" alt="Chart"/>
<p class="icap">Chart displaying the drop in surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita passed over</p>
</div>
<p class="cont">The passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean can cause the upper ocean to cool substantially, which
can influence subsequent cyclone development. Tropical cyclones cool the ocean by acting like "heat engines" that transfer
heat from the ocean surface to the atmosphere through evaporation. Cooling is also caused by upwelling of cold water from
below. Additional cooling may come from cold water from raindrops that remain on the ocean surface for a time. Cloud cover
may also play a role in cooling the ocean by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after
the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area
in just a few days.</p>
<p class="cont">Scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at
the rate of 50 to 200 trillion joules per day. For comparison, this rate of energy release is equivalent to exploding
a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20 minutes or 200 times the world-wide electrical generating capacity per day.</p>
<p class="cont">While the most obvious motion of clouds is toward the center, tropical cyclones also develop an upper-level
(high-altitude) outward flow of clouds. These originate from air that has released its moisture and is expelled
at high altitude through the "chimney" of the storm engine. This outflow produces high, thin cirrus clouds that
spiral away from the center. The high cirrus clouds may be the first signs of an approaching tropical cyclone.</p>
<h3>Physical structure</h3>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:350px">
<img class="ipic" src="Hurricane_structure_graphic.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the structure of a hurricane"/>
<p class="icap">Structure of a hurricane</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">A strong tropical cyclone consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Surface low:</b> All tropical cyclones rotate around an area of low atmospheric pressure near the Earth's surface.
The pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest that occur on Earth's surface at sea level.</li> 
<li><b>Warm core:</b> Tropical cyclones are characterized and driven by the release of large amounts of latent heat of
condensation as moist air is carried upwards and its water vapor condenses. This heat is distributed vertically,
around the center of the storm. Thus, at any given altitude (except close to the surface where water temperature dictates
air temperature) the environment inside the cyclone is warmer than its outer surroundings.</li>
<li><b>Central Dense Overcast (CDO):</b> The Central Dense Overcast is the shield of cirrus clouds produced by the eyewall
thunderstorms. Typically, these are the highest and coldest clouds in the cyclone.</li>
<li><b>Eye:</b> A strong tropical cyclone will harbor an area of sinking air at the center of circulation. Weather
in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds (however, the sea may be extremely violent). The eye is normally circular
in shape, and may range in size from 3 km to 320 km (2 miles to 200 miles) in diameter. In weaker cyclones, the CDO
covers the circulation center, resulting in no visible eye.</li>
<li><b>Eyewall:</b> A band around the eye of greatest wind speed, where clouds reach highest and precipitation is heaviest.
The heaviest wind damage occurs where a hurricane's eyewall passes over land.</li>
<li><b>Rainbands:</b> Bands of showers and thunderstorms that spiral cyclonically toward the storm center. High wind gusts
and heavy downpours often occur in individual rainbands, with relatively calm weather between bands. Tornadoes often form
in the rainbands of landfalling tropical cyclones. Annular hurricanes are distinctive for their lack of rainbands.</li>
<li><b>Outflow:</b> The upper levels of a tropical cyclone feature winds headed away from the center of the storm with
an anticyclonic rotation. Winds at the surface are strongly cyclonic, weaken with height, and eventually reverse themselves.
Tropical cyclones owe this unique characteristic to the warm core at the center of the storm.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="formation">Formation</h2>
<h3>Factors in Formation</h3>
<p class="lead">The formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood.
Six factors appear to be generally necessary, although tropical cyclones may occasionally form without meeting all of
these conditions:</p>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:800px">
<img class="ipic" src="800px-Irene_TRM_20050815_lrg.jpg" alt="TRMM image"/>
<p class="icap">This TRMM image shows the height of rain columns within Hurricane Irene.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Water temperatures of at least 26.5 °C (80°F) down to a depth of at least 50 m (150 feet). Waters of this temperature
cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms.</li>
<li>Rapid cooling with height. This allows the release of latent heat, which is the source of energy in a tropical cyclone.</li>
<li>High humidity, especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere. When there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere,
conditions are more favourable for disturbances to develop.</li>
<li>Low wind shear. When wind shear is high, the convection in a cyclone or disturbance will be disrupted, preventing formation
of the feedback loop.</li>
<li>Distance from the equator. This allows the Coriolis force to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center,
causing a circulation. The minimum distance is about 500 km (310 miles) or 5 degrees from the equator.</li>
<li>A pre-existing system of disturbed weather. The system must have some sort of circulation as well as a low pressure center.</li>
</ol>
<div class="ibox_l" style="max-width:350px">
<img class="ipic" src="Atlantic_hurricane_graphic.gif" alt="Atlantic hurracains"/>
<p class="icap">Waves in the trade winds in the Atlantic Ocean — areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the
prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.</p>
</div>
<p class="cont">Tropical cyclones generally form from four different types of systems: monsoon troughs, tropical
waves, non-tropical lows, and decaying frontal boundaries. Monsoon troughs are the main trigger of tropical cyclone formation
worldwide, which are broad areas of converging winds from both hemispheres. When the monsoon trough strengthens either due
to strengthening high pressure to its north or increases flow from across the equator from the opposite hemisphere, thunderstorm
activity increases and tropical cyclogenesis can occur. Tropical cyclones form most often in the tropical Atlantic and northeast
Pacific ocean from tropical waves, also called easterly waves, which are westward-moving areas of convergent winds. Tropical
waves often carry with them clusters of thunderstorms, which can develop into tropical cyclones. A similar phenomenon to tropical
waves are West African disturbance lines, which are squalls that form over Africa and move into the Atlantic, often as a part of
the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Tropical cyclones also frequently form from upper tropospheric troughs, which are cold-core
upper level lows. A warm-core tropical cyclone may result when one of these works down to the lower levels and produces deep
convection. Off-season tropical cyclones most often form in this manner. Finally, decaying frontal boundaries may occasionally
stall over warm waters and produce lines of active convection. If a low-level circulation forms under this convection, it may
develop into a tropical cyclone.</p>
<h3>Locations of formation</h3>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:800px">
<img class="ipic" src="800px-Global_tropical_cyclone_tracks-edit2.jpg" alt="Cumulative cyclone tracks"/>
<p class="icap">Cumulative tracks of all cyclones from 1985 to 2005</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Most tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity called by several names: the Intertropical Discontinuity
(ITD), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough.</p>
<p class="cont">Most of these systems form between 10 and 30 degrees of the equator and 87% form within 20 degrees of it. Because the Coriolis
effect initiates and maintains tropical cyclone rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within about 5 degrees of the equator,
where the Coriolis effect is weakest. However, it is possible for tropical cyclones to form within this boundary as did Typhoon Vamei
in 2001 and Cyclone Agni in 2004.</p>
<h4>Major basins</h4>
<p class="lead">Traditionally, areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins. These include the north Atlantic Ocean,
the eastern and western parts of the Pacific Ocean (considered separately because tropical cyclones rarely form in the central Pacific),
the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans, and the northern Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic is the most
studied of the basins, while the Western Pacific is the most active and the North Indian the least active. Worldwide, an average
of 80 tropical cyclones form each year.</p>

<p class="lead">Additionally, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues informal advisories in all basins except the Northern Atlantic
and Northeastern Pacific. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issues
informal advisories, as well as names, for tropical cyclones that approach the Philippines in the Northwestern Pacific.
The Canadian Hurricane Centre (CHC) issues advisories on hurricanes and their remnants that affect Canada.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Northern Atlantic Ocean:</b> The most-studied of all tropical basins, it includes the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea,
and the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclone formation here varies widely from year to year, ranging from over twenty to one per year
with an average of around ten. The United States Atlantic coast, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean Islands, and Bermuda are
frequently affected by storms in this basin. Venezuela, the south-east of Canada and Atlantic "Macaronesian" islands are also
occasionally affected. Many of the more intense Atlantic storms are Cape Verde-type hurricanes, which form off the west coast
of Africa near the Cape Verde islands. Rarely, a hurricane can reach western Europe, including Hurricane Lili, which dissipated
over the British Isles in October 1996, and Tropical Storm Vince, which made landfall on the southwestern coast of Spain in
September 2005.</li>
<li><b>Northeastern Pacific Ocean:</b> This is the second most active basin in the world, and the most dense (a large number
of storms for a small area of ocean). Storms that form here can affect western Mexico, Hawaii, northern Central America,
and on extremely rare occasions, California and Arizona. There is no record of a hurricane ever reaching California; however,
to some meteorologists, historical records in 1858 spoke of a storm that struck San Diego with winds over 75 m.p.h., above
hurricane force.</li>
<li><b>Northwestern Pacific Ocean:</b> Tropical storm activity in this region frequently affects China, Japan, Hong Kong,
the Philippines, and Taiwan, but also many other countries in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, South Korea, and parts
of Indonesia, plus numerous Oceanian islands. This is by far the most active basin, accounting for one-third of all tropical
cyclone activity in the world. The coast of China sees the most landfalling tropical cyclones worldwide. The Philippines receives
an average 18 typhoon landings per year. Rarely does a typhoon or an extratropical storm reach northward to Siberia, Russia.</li>
<li><b>Northern Indian Ocean:</b> This basin is divided into two areas, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, with the Bay of
Bengal dominating (5 to 6 times more activity). This basin's season has an interesting double peak; one in April and May before
the onset of the monsoon, and another in October and November just after.(see data, [2]) Tropical cyclones which form in this
basin have historically cost the most lives — most notably, the 1970 Bhola cyclone killed 200,000. Nations affected by this
basin include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan. Rarely, a tropical cyclone formed in this basin
will affect the Arabian Peninsula.</li>
<li><b>Southwestern Pacific Ocean:</b> Tropical activity in this region largely affects Australia and Oceania. On rare occasions,
tropical storms reach the vicinity of Brisbane, Australia and into New Zealand, usually during or after extratropical transition.</li>
<li><b>Southeastern Indian Ocean:</b> Tropical activity in this region affects Australia and Indonesia. According to the
Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the most frequently hit portion of Australia is between Exmouth and Broome in Western Australia.</li>
<li><b>Southwestern Indian Ocean:</b> This basin is the least understood, due to a lack of historical data. Cyclones forming here
impact Madagascar, Mozambique, Mauritius, Reunion, Comoros, Tanzania, and Kenya.</li> 
</ul>
<h4>Unusual formation areas</h4>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:600px">
<img class="ipic" src="600px-Hurricane_Vince_eye_2005.jpg" alt="Hurricane Vince view from space"/>
<p class="icap">Hurricane Vince formed in the temperate subtropics during the 2005 Atlantic season.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">The following areas spawn tropical cyclones only very rarely.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Temperate subtropics:</b> Areas farther than thirty degrees from the equator are not normally conducive to tropical
cyclone formation or strengthening, and areas more than forty degrees from the equator are very hostile to such development.
The primary limiting factor is water temperatures, although higher shear at increasing latitudes is also a factor. These areas
are sometimes frequented by cyclones moving poleward from tropical latitudes. On rare occasions, such as in 1988 and 1975
storms may form or strengthen in this region.</li>
<li><b>Low latitudes:</b> Areas within approximately ten degrees latitude of the equator do not experience a significant
Coriolis Force, a vital ingredient in tropical cyclone formation. However, in December 2001, Typhoon Vamei formed in the
Southern South China Sea and made landfall in Malaysia. It formed from a thunderstorm formation in Borneo that moved
into the South China Sea.</li>
<li><b>Southeastern Pacific:</b> Tropical cyclone formation is rare in this region; when they do form, it is frequently
linked to El Niño episodes. Most of the storms that enter this region formed farther west in the Southwest Pacific.
They affect the islands of Polynesia in exceptional instances. During the 1982/83 El Niño event, French Polynesia
was affected by six tropical cyclones in five months. In addition, there are no records of a tropical cyclone hitting
western South America.</li>
<li><b>South Atlantic:</b> A combination of wind shear and a lack of tropical disturbances from the Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) makes it very difficult for the South Atlantic to support tropical activity. However, three
tropical cyclones have been observed here — a weak tropical storm in 1991 off the coast of Africa, Cyclone Catarina
(sometimes also referred to as Aldonça), which made landfall in Brazil in 2004 at Category 1 strength, and a smaller
storm in January 2004, east of Salvador, Brazil. The January storm is thought to have reached tropical storm intensity
based on scatterometer winds.</li>
<li><b>Mediterranean Sea:</b> Storms that appear similar to tropical cyclones in structure sometimes occur in the
Mediterranean basin. Examples of these "Mediterranean tropical cyclones" formed in September 1947, September 1969,
January 1982, September 1983, and January 1995. However, there is debate on whether these storms were tropical in nature.</li> 
<li><b>The Great Lakes:</b> A storm system that appeared similar to a tropical cyclone formed in 1996 on Lake Huron.
It formed an eye-like structure in its center, and it may have briefly been a tropical cyclone.
The Great Lakes has a long history of rare but eventful cyclonic storms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Times of formation</h3>
<p class="lead">Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when water temperatures are warmest.
However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month,
while September is the most active.</p>
<p class="cont">In the North Atlantic, a distinct hurricane season occurs from June 1 to November 30, sharply
peaking from late August through September. The statistical peak of the North Atlantic hurricane season is September 10.
The Northeast Pacific has a broader period of activity, but in a similar time frame to the Atlantic. The Northwest
Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and a peak in early September.
In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with peaks in May and November.</p>
<p class="cont">In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical cyclone activity begins in late October and ends in May.
Southern Hemisphere activity peaks in mid-February to early March.</p>

<h2 id="movement">Movement and track</h2>
<h3>Large-scale winds</h3>
<p class="lead">Although tropical cyclones are large systems generating enormous energy, their movements
over the earth's surface are controlled by large-scale winds—the streams in the earth's atmosphere. The path
of motion is referred to as a tropical cyclone's track, and has been compared by Dr. Neil Frank, former director
of the National Hurricane Center, as "leaves carried along by a stream."</p>
<p class="cont">The major force affecting the track of tropical systems in all areas are winds circulating
around high-pressure areas. Over the north Atlantic Ocean, tropical systems are steered generally westward
by the east-to-west winds on the south side of the "Bermuda High", a persistent high-pressure area over the
north Atlantic. Also, in the area of the North Atlantic where hurricanes form, trade winds, which are prevailing
westward-moving wind currents, steer tropical waves westward from the African coast and towards the Caribbean
and North America. These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones and are the main source of
Atlantic hurricanes during most seasons, and also play a significant role in the formation of tropical
cyclones in the Eastern Pacific.</p>
<p class="cont">In the Indian Ocean and western Pacific (north and south of the equator), tropical cyclogenesis
is strongly influenced by the seasonal movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, rather than by easterly waves.
In these basins as well, tropical cyclone paths are broadly determined by synoptic scale features.</p>
<h3>Coriolis effect</h3>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:550px">

<img class="ipic" src="Cyclone_Monica.gif" alt="Infrared image of the cyclone Monica"/>
<p class="icap">Infrared image of Cyclone Monica near peak intensity, showing clockwise rotation due to the Coriolis effect.

</div>
<p class="lead">The earth's rotation also imparts an acceleration (termed the Coriolis Acceleration or Coriolis Effect).
This acceleration causes cyclonic systems to turn towards the poles in the absence of strong steering currents (i.e. in
the north, the northern part of the cyclone has winds to the west, and the Coriolis force pulls them slightly north.
The southern part is pulled south, but since it is closer to the equator, the Coriolis force is a bit weaker there).
Thus, tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere, which commonly move west in the beginning, normally turn north
(and are then usually blown east), and cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere are deflected south, if no strong pressure
systems are counteracting the Coriolis acceleration. The Coriolis acceleration also initiates cyclonic rotation, but
it is not the driving force that brings this rotation to high speeds. These speeds are due to the conservation of
angular momentum - air is drawn in from an area much larger than the cyclone such that the tiny rotational speed
(originally imparted by the Coriolis acceleration) is magnified greatly as the air is drawn in to the low pressure center.</p>
<h3>Interaction with high and low pressure systems</h3>
<p class="lead">Finally, when a tropical cyclone moves into higher latitude, its general track around a high-pressure
area can be deflected significantly by winds moving toward a low-pressure area. Such a track direction change is termed
recurve. A hurricane moving from the Atlantic toward the Gulf of Mexico, for example, will recurve to the north and then
northeast if it encounters winds blowing northeastward toward a low-pressure system passing over North America.
Many tropical cyclones along the East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico are eventually forced toward the northeast
by low-pressure areas which move from west to east over North America.</p>
<h3>Landfall</h3>
<p class="lead">Officially, "landfall" is when a storm's center (the center of the eye, not its edge) reaches land.
Naturally, storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland well before landfall. In fact, for a storm
moving inland, the landfall area experiences half the storm before the actual landfall. For emergency preparedness,
actions should be timed from when a certain wind speed will reach land, not from when landfall will occur.</p>
<h2 id="dissipation">Dissipation</h2>
<p class="lead">A tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, and quickly loses strength.
Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure
within a day or two. There is, however, a chance they could regenerate if they manage to get back over open warm water.
If a storm is over mountains for even a short time, it can rapidly lose its structure. However, many storm fatalities
occur in mountainous terrain, as the dying storm unleashes torrential rainfall which can lead to deadly floods and mudslides.</li>
<li>It remains in the same area of ocean for too long, drawing heat off of the ocean surface until it becomes
too cool to support the storm. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.</li>
<li>It experiences wind shear, causing the convection to lose direction and the heat engine to break down.</li>
<li>It can be weak enough to be consumed by another area of low pressure, disrupting it and joining to become
a large area of non-cyclonic thunderstorms. (Such, however, can strengthen the non-tropical system as a whole.)</li>
<li>It enters colder waters. This does not necessarily mean the death of the storm, but the storm will lose its tropical
characteristics. These storms are extratropical cyclones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="cont">Even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated, it can still have tropical
storm force (or occasionally hurricane force) winds and drop several inches of rainfall. When a tropical cyclone reaches
higher latitudes or passes over land, it may merge with weather fronts or develop into a frontal cyclone, also called
extratropical cyclone. In the Atlantic ocean, such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and
may occasionally remain at hurricane-force wind speeds when they reach Europe as a European windstorm, such as the
extratropical remnants of Hurricane Iris in 1995.</p>
<h3>Artificial dissipation</h3>
<p class="lead">In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States government attempted to weaken hurricanes in its Project Stormfury
by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It was thought that the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer
rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie
dropped as much as 30 percent, but then regained their strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode
in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded,
and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because there was so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal
government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10 percent chance of making landfall
within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered
that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts.
Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in
the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.</p>
<p class="cont">Other approaches have been suggested over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone
by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages so that
latent heat is absorbed by ice at the entrance (storm cell perimeter bottom) instead of heat energy being converted
to kinetic energy at high altitudes vertically above, covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation,
or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone.
These approaches all suffer from the same flaw: tropical cyclones are simply too large for any of them to be practical.</p>

</div>
<p class="lead">A mature tropical cyclone can release heat at a rate upwards of 6×10<sup>14</sup> watts. Tropical cyclones on the
open sea cause large waves, heavy rain, and high winds, disrupting international shipping and sometimes sinking ships. However,
the most devastating effects of a tropical cyclone occur when they cross coastlines, making landfall. A tropical cyclone moving
over land can do direct damage in four ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>High winds</b> - Hurricane strength winds can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, etc. High winds also
turn loose debris into flying projectiles, making the outdoor environment even more dangerous.</li>
<li><b>Storm surge</b> - Tropical cyclones cause an increase in sea level, which can flood coastal communities. This is the
worst effect, as historically cyclones claimed 80% of their victims when they first strike shore.</li>
<li><b>Heavy rain</b> - The thunderstorm activity in a tropical cyclone causes intense rainfall. Rivers and streams flood,
roads become impassable, and landslides can occur. Inland areas are particularly vulnerable to freshwater flooding,
due to residents not preparing adequately.</li>
<li><b>Tornado activity</b> - The broad rotation of a hurricane often spawns tornadoes. Also, tornadoes can be spawned
as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall. While these tornadoes are normally not as strong
as their non-tropical counterparts, they can still cause tremendous damage.</li>

</div>
<p class="lead">Often, the secondary effects of a tropical cyclone are equally damaging. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Disease</b> - The wet environment in the aftermath of a tropical cyclone, combined with the destruction of sanitation
facilities and a warm tropical climate, can induce epidemics of disease which claim lives long after the storm passes.
One of the most common post-hurricane injuries is stepping on a nail in storm debris, leading to a risk of tetanus or other
infection. Infections of cuts and bruises can be greatly amplified by wading in sewage-polluted water. Large areas
of standing water caused by flooding also contribute to mosquito-borne illnesses.</li>
<li><b>Power outages</b> - Tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people (or occasionally
millions if a large urban area is affected), prohibiting vital communication and hampering rescue efforts.</li>
<li><b>Transportation difficulties</b> - Tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges, overpasses, and roads, complicating
efforts to transport food, clean water, and medicine to the areas that need it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Beneficial effects of tropical cyclones</h3>
<p class="lead">Although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors
in the precipitation regimes of places they impact and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Hurricanes
in the eastern north Pacific often supply moisture to the Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Japan receives
over half of its rainfall from typhoons. Hurricane Camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much
of its path, killing 259 people and causing $9.14 billion 2005 USD in damages.</p>
<p class="cont">Hurricanes also help to maintain global heat balance by moving warm, moist tropical air to the mid-latitudes
and polar regions. Were it not for the movement of heat poleward (through other means as well as hurricanes), the tropical
regions would be unbearably hot. The storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures,
but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish breeding locales.</p>
<p class="cont">In addition, the destruction caused by Camille on the Gulf coast spurred redevelopment as well, greatly increasing
local property values. On the other hand, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people
to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. Hurricane Katrina is the most obvious example, as it
devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Of course, many former residents and businesses
do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well.</p>
<p class="cont">At sea, tropical cyclones can stir up water, leaving a cool wake behind them. This can cause the region
to be less favourable for a subsequent tropical cyclone. On rare occasions, tropical cyclones may actually do the opposite.
2005's Hurricane Dennis blew warm water behind it, contributing to the unprecedented intensity of the close-following
Hurricane Emily.</p>
<h2 id="trends">Long term trends in cyclone activity</h2>
<p class="lead">While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there seems to be no signs of
a numerical global trend; the annual global number of tropical cyclones remains about 90 ± 10. However, there is some
evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. "Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both
the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering
all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30 years or so, corresponding to about a 15%
increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime."</p>
<p class="cont">Atlantic storms are certainly becoming more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive
storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. This can be attributed to the increased intensity and duration of
hurricanes striking North America and to the number of people living in susceptible coastal area following increased development
in the region since the last surge in Atlantic hurricane activity in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="cont">Often in part because of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse population between
major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast
may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the
number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology.
Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early
data as suspect</p>
<p class="cont">The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50-70 year cycle. Although more common since 1995,
few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970-1994. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926-60, including
many major New England hurricanes. A record 21 Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, only recently exceeded in 2005. Tropical
hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900-1925; however, many intense storms formed 1870-1899. During the 1887
season, 19 tropical storms formed, of which a record 4 occurred after 1 November and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes
occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 1800s, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City,
which some historical weather experts say may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.</p>
<p class="cont">These unusually active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin that now enables
forecasters to see all tropical cyclones. Before the satellite era began in 1961, tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected
unless a ship reported a voyage through the storm. The official record, therefore, could miss storms in which no ship experienced
gale-force winds, recognized it as a tropical storm (as opposed to a high-latitude extra-tropical cyclone, a tropical wave,
or a brief squall), returned to port, and reported the experience.</p>
<h3>Global warming</h3>
<p class="lead">A common question is whether global warming can or will cause more frequent or more fierce tropical cyclones. So far, virtually
all climatologists seem to agree that a single storm, or even a single season, cannot clearly be attributed to a single cause
such as global warming or natural variation. The question is thus whether a statistical trend in frequency or strength of
cyclones exists. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory performed
a simulation that concluded "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes
over the next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."</p>
<p class="cont">In an article in Nature, Kerry Emanuel states that the potential hurricane destructiveness, a measure which combines
strength, duration, and frequency of hurricanes, "is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented
climate signals, including multidecadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming." K. Emanuel further
predicts "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century."</p>
<p class="cont">Along similar lines, P.J. Webster and others published an article in Science examining "changes in tropical
cyclone number, duration, and intensity" over the last 35 years, a period where satellite data is available. The main finding is that
while the number of cyclones "decreased in all basins except the North Atlantic during the past decade" there is a "large increase in
the number and proportion of hurricanes reaching categories 4 and 5." That is, while the number of cyclones decreased overall, the
number of very strong cyclones increased.</p>
<p class="cont">Both Emanuel and Webster et al., consider the sea surface temperature as of key importance in the development of cyclones.
The question then becomes: what caused the observed increase in sea surface temperatures? In the Atlantic, it could be due to global
warming and the hypothesized Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a possible 50–70 year pattern of temperature variability. Emanuel,
however, found the recent temperature increase was outside the range of previous sea surface temperature peaks. So, both global
warming and a natural variation (such as the AMO) could have made contributions to the warming of the tropical Atlantic over the past
decades, but an exact attribution is so far impossible to make.</p>
<p class="cont">While Emanuel analyzes total annual energy dissipation, Webster et al. analyze the percentage of hurricanes in the combined
categories 4 and 5, and find that this percentage has increased in each of six distinct hurricane basins: North Atlantic, North East
and North West Pacific, South Pacific, and North and South Indian.</p>
<p class="cont">Under the assumption that the six basins are statistically independent except for the effect of global warming,
has carried out the obvious paired t-test and found that the null-hypothesis of no impact of global warming on the percentage
of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes can be rejected at the 0.1% level. Thus, there is only a 1 in 1000 chance of simultaneously finding
the observed six increases in the percentages of Category 4 or 5 hurricanes. This statistic needs refining because the variables being
tested are not normally distributed with equal variances, but it may provide the best evidence yet that the impact of global warming on
hurricane intensity has been detected.</p>

<h3>Observation</h3>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:600px">
<img class="ipic" src="Isidore091902-p3sunset2.jpg" alt="photo from a plane"/>
<p class="icap">Sunset view of Hurricane Isidore's rainbands photographed at 7,000 feet.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge. As they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon,
weather stations are rarely available on the site of the storm itself. Surface level observations are generally available only
if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if it has overtaken an unfortunate ship. Even in these cases,
real-time measurements are generally possible only in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic.</p>
<p class="cont">It is however possible to take in-situ measurements, in real-time, by sending specially equipped reconnaissance
flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters.
The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly
into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone.
These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface.</p>
<p class="cont">A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown
through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. This demonstrated a new
way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.</p>
<p class="cont">Tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space,
usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land, it can be observed by land-based Doppler radar.
Radar plays a crucial role around landfall because it shows a storm's location and intensity minute by minute.</p>
<p class="cont">Recently, academic researchers have begun to deploy mobile weather stations fortified to withstand hurricane-force winds.
The two largest programs are the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program and the Wind Engineering Mobile Instrumented Tower Experiment.
During landfall, the NOAA Hurricane Research Division compares and verifies data from reconnaissance aircraft, including wind speed
data taken at flight level and from GPS dropwindsondes and stepped-frequency microwave radiometers, to wind speed data transmitted
in real time from weather stations erected near or at the coast. The National Hurricane Center uses the data to evaluate conditions
at landfall and to verify forecasts.</p>
<h3>Forecasting</h3>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:800px">
<img class="ipic" src="800px-Epsilon_ISS012-E-10097.jpg" alt="Hurricane Epsilon's view from space"/>
<p class="icap">Hurricane Epsilon organized and strengthened despite extremely unfavorable conditions.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining
the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during the life of
a tropical system.</p>
<p class="cont">With their understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones, and a wealth of data from earth-orbiting
satellites and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades. High-speed computers
and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that forecast tropical cyclone tracks based
on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. But while track forecasts have become more accurate than
20 years ago, scientists say they are less skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones. They attribute the lack of
improvement in intensity forecasting to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect
their development.</p>
<h2 id="naming">Classifications, Terminology and Naming</h2>
<h3>Intensity classifications</h3>
<div class="ibox_wr" style="max-width:20.5em;min-width:10em">
<img class="ipic_float" src="480px-Typhoon_saomai_060807.jpg" style="max-width:10em;min-width:5em" alt="three tropical cyclones"/>
<p class="icap">Three tropical cyclones at different stages of development. The youngest, on the left, demonstrates only the most
basic circular shape. The storm at the top right, a few days older, demonstrates spiral banding and increased centralization,
while the storm in the lower right, the oldest, has developed a cyclonic eye.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups, based on intensity: tropical depressions, tropical storms,
and a third group of more intense storms, whose name depends on the region.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b>tropical depression</b> is an organized system of clouds and thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum
sustained winds of less than 17 m/s (33 kt, 38 mph, or 62 km/h). It has no eye, and does not typically have the organization
or the spiral shape of more powerful storms. It is already a low-pressure system, however, hence the name "depression."</li>
<li>A <b>tropical storm</b> is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained
winds between 17 and 32 m/s (34–63 kt, 39–73 mph, or 62–117 km/h). At this point, the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop,
though an eye is usually not present. Government weather services assign first names to systems that reach this intensity
(thus the term <i>named storm</i>).</li>
<li>A <b>hurricane</b> or <b>typhoon</b> (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone, as opposed to a depression or
storm) is a system with sustained winds greater than 33 m/s (64 kt, 74 mph, or 118 km/h).[1] A tropical cyclone tends to develop
an eye, an area of relative calm (and lowest atmospheric pressure) at the center of circulation. The eye is often
visible in satellite images as a small, circular, cloud-free spot. Surrounding the eye is the eyewall, an area about 10–50 mi
(16–80 km) wide in which the strongest thunderstorms and winds circulate around the storm's center.</li>
</ul>
<p class="cont">The circulation of clouds around a cyclone's center imparts a distinct spiral shape to the system. Bands or
arms may extend over great distances as clouds are drawn toward the cyclone. The direction of the cyclonic circulation depends
on the hemisphere; it is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Maximum sustained
winds in the strongest tropical cyclones have been measured at more than 85 m/s (165 kt, 190 mph, 305 km/h). Intense, mature
hurricanes can sometimes exhibit an inward curving of the eyewall top that resembles a football stadium: this phenomenon
is thus sometimes referred to as the stadium effect.</p>
<p class="cont">Eyewall replacement cycles naturally occur in intense tropical cyclones. When cyclones reach peak intensity
they usually - but not always - have an eyewall and radius of maximum winds that contract to a very small size, around
5 to 15 miles. At this point, some of the outer rainbands may organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly
moves inward and robs the inner eyewall of its needed moisture and momentum. During this phase, the tropical cyclone is
weakening (i.e.,... the maximum winds die off a bit and the central pressure goes up). Eventually the outer eyewall
replaces the inner one completely and the storm can be the same intensity as it was previously or, in some cases, even stronger.
Even if the cyclone is weaker at the end of the eyewall replacement cycle, the fact that it has just undergone one and will
not undergo another one soon will allow it to strengthen further, if other conditions allow it to do so.</p>

</table>
<p class="lead">Hurricanes are ranked according to their maximum winds using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. A Category 1
storm has the lowest maximum winds (74-95 mph, 119-153 km/h), a Category 5 hurricane has the highest (&gt; 155 mph, 249 km/h).
The U.S. National Hurricane Center classifies hurricanes of Category 3 and above as <i>major hurricanes.</i></p>
<p class="cont">The U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center classifies West Pacific typhoons as tropical cyclones with winds
greater than 73 mph (118 km/h). Typhoons with wind speeds of at least 150 mph (67 m/s or 241 km/h, equivalent
to a strong Category 4 hurricane) are dubbed <i>Super Typhoons.</i></p>
<p class="cont">The Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses a 1-5 scale called tropical cyclone severity categories. Unlike
the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, severity categories are based on estimated maximum wind gusts. A category 1 storm
features gusts less than 126 km/h (78 mph), while gusts in a category 5 cyclone are at least 280 km/h (174 mph).</p>
<p class="cont">Meteorologists in the United States use maximum 1-minute average sustained winds 10 meters above the
ground to determine tropical cyclone strength. Other countries use the maximum 10-minute average, as suggested by
the World Meteorological Organization. Maximum wind speeds are typically about 12% lower with the 10-minute method
than with the 1-minute method.</p>
<p class="cont">The rankings are not absolute in terms of damage and other effects, since it only based on windspeed.
Lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms, depending on factors such as local terrain
and total rainfall. For instance, a Category 2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage
than a large Category 5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region. In fact, tropical systems of minimal strength
can produce significant damage and human casualties from flooding and landslides, particularly if they are slow-moving
or very large in size.</p>
<h3>Regional terminology</h3>

<p class="icap">Eye of Typhoon Odessa, Pacific Ocean, August 1985.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Depending on their current basin and intensity, tropical cyclones may be referred to using one of many
different terms, and each basin uses a separate system of terminology, making comparison difficult. Tropical cyclones
which cross from one basin into another may then be referred to as a tropical cyclone of the type in the new basin rather
than its original basin. This, however, is only common in the Pacific Ocean, where hurricanes from the Central North Pacific
sometimes cross into the Northwest Pacific and are called typhoons. On very rare occasions, a typhoon will cross into the
Central Pacific and become known as a hurricane. No other types of basin crossings that would result in a change of term
have been recorded. Additionally, most basins use a 10-minute average of sustained wind speeds to determine intensity,
as recommended by the WMO, but this is not the case in the North Atlantic and Northeastern Pacific, where 1-minute averages,
almost always higher, are used.</p>
<h4>Origin of storm terms</h4>
<p class="lead">The word <i>typhoon</i> has two possible origins:</p>
<ul>
<li>From "daaih fung" (Cantonese) or "dà feng" (Mandarin) which means "great wind."</li>
<li>From Urdu, Persian or Arabic "tufan", Greek tuphon. Portuguese tufão is also related to typhoon.</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">The word <i>hurricane</i> is derived from the name of a native Caribbean Amerindian storm god, Huracan,
via Spanish <i>huracán</i>.</p>
<p class="cont">The word <i>cyclone</i> was coined by a Captain Henry Piddington, who used it to refer to the storm that blew
a freighter in circles in Mauritius in February of 1845. Tropical cyclones are then circular wind storms that form in
the tropics.</p>
<h3>Naming of tropical cyclones</h3>
<p class="lead">Storms reaching tropical storm strength are given names, to assist in recording insurance claims, to assist
in warning people of the coming storm, and to further indicate that these are important storms that should not be ignored.
These names are taken from lists which vary from region to region and are drafted a few years ahead of time. The lists
are decided upon, depending on the regions, either by committees of the World Meteorological Organization (called primarily
to discuss many other issues), or by national weather offices involved in the forecasting of the storms.</p>
<p class="cont">Each year, the names of particularly destructive storms (if there are any) are "retired" and new names are
chosen to take their place.</p>
<h4>Naming schemes</h4>
<p class="lead">In the North Atlantic and Northeastern Pacific regions, feminine and masculine names are alternated in alphabetic
order during a given season. The gender of the season's first storm also alternates year to year. Six lists of names
are prepared in advance, and each list is used once every six years. Five letters — "Q," "U," "X," "Y" and "Z" — are
omitted in the North Atlantic; only "Q" and "U" are omitted in the Northeastern Pacific. This allows for 21 names
in the North Atlantic and 24 names in Northeastern Pacific. Names of storms may be retired by request of affected countries
if they have caused extensive damage. The affected countries then decide on a replacement name of the same gender,
and if possible, the same language as the name being retired. If there are more than 21 named storms in an Atlantic
season or 24 named storms in an Eastern Pacific season, the rest are named as letters from the Greek alphabet. This
was first necessary during the 2005 Atlantic season when the list was exhausted. There is no precedent for a storm
named with a Greek letter causing enough damage to justify retirement; how this situation would be handled is unknown.</p>
<p class="cont">In the Central North Pacific region, the name lists are maintained by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu,
Hawaii. Four lists of Hawaiian names are selected and used in sequential order without regard to year.</p>
<p class="cont">In the Northwestern Pacific, name lists are maintained by the WMO Typhoon Committee. Five lists of names are used, with
each of the 14 nations on the Typhoon Committee submitting two names to each list. Names are used in the order of the countries'
English names, sequentially without regard to year. Since 1981, the numbering system had been the primary system to identify
tropical cyclone among Typhoon Committee members and it is still in use. International numbers are assigned by Japan
Meteorological Agency on the order that a tropical storm forms while different internal numbers may be assigned by
different NMCs. The Typhoon "Songda" in September 2004 was internally called the typhoon number 18 in Japan but typhoon
number 19 in China. Internationally, it is recorded as the TY Sonda (0418) with "04" taken from the year. Names
are retired from the lists upon request. The most common reason is to memorize the extensive damage caused by the
storm. When names are retired, the contributing member should propose new names. A possible way to do so is through
local name nomination contest, which was done in Hong Kong and China.</p>
<p class="cont">The Australian Bureau of Meteorology maintains three lists of names, one for each of the Western, Northern and
Eastern Australian regions. These lists are in alphabetical order and alternate gender, but are used sequentially rather
than switched each year. There are also Fiji region and Papua New Guinea region names agreed upon WMO RA V Tropical
Cyclone Committee members.</p>
<p class="cont">The RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South-West Indian Ocean creates the lists of names for the Southwestern
Indian Ocean. The committee adopted two separate lists of names for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 tropical cyclone seasons at
its October 2005 meeting in Gaborone, Botswana. Nominations for the lists were submitted by Mauritius, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Botswana, Comoros, Lesotho, and Madagascar. If a tropical
disturbance reaches "moderate tropical storm" status west of 55 degrees east longitude, then the Sub-regional Tropical
Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a tropical disturbance reaches
"moderate tropical storm" status between 55 and 90 degrees east longitude, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory
Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm.</p>
<h4>Renaming of tropical cyclones</h4>
<p class="lead">In most cases, a tropical cyclone retains its name throughout its life. However, a tropical cyclone may be
renamed in several occasions.</p>
<ol>
<li><div class="def">A tropical storm enters the southwestern Indian Ocean from the east</div>
<p class="cont">In the southwestern Indian Ocean, Météo-France in Réunion names a tropical storm once it crosses 90°E from the east, even
though it has been named. In this case, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) will put two names together with a hyphen.
Examples include Cyclone Adeline-Juliet in early 2005 and Cyclone Bertie-Alvin in late 2005.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="def">A tropical storm crosses from the Atlantic into the Pacific, or vice versa, before 2001</div>
<p class="cont">It was the policy of National Hurricane Center (NHC) to rename a tropical storm which crossed from Atlantic
into Pacific, or vice versa. Examples include Hurricane Cesar-Douglas in 1996 and Hurricane Joan-Miriam in 1988.</p>
<p class="cont">In 2001, when Iris moved across Central America, NHC mentioned that Iris would retain its name if it regenerated
in the Pacific. However, the Pacific tropical depression developed from the remnants of Iris was called Fifteen-E instead.
The depression later became tropical storm Manuel.</p>
<p class="cont">NHC explained that Iris had dissipated as a tropical cyclone prior to entering the eastern North Pacific basin;
the new depression was properly named Fifteen-E, rather than Iris.</p>
<p class="cont">In 2003, when Larry was about to move across Mexico, NHC attempted to provide greater clarity:</p>
<blockquote><p class="lead">"Should Larry remain a tropical cyclone during its passage over Mexico into the Pacific, it would retain its name.
However, a new name would be given if the surface circulation dissipates and then regenerates in the Pacific."</p></blockquote>
<p class="cont">Up to now, there has been no tropical cyclone retaining its name during the passage from Atlantic to Pacific,
or vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="def">Uncertainties of the continuation</div>
<p class="cont">When the remnants of a tropical cyclone redevelop, the redeveloping system will be treated as a new tropical
cyclone if there are uncertainties of the continuation, even though the original system may contribute to the forming of the
new system. One example is Tropical Depression 10 - Tropical Depression 12 (which became Hurricane Katrina) from 2005.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="def">Human errors</div>
<p class="cont">Sometimes, there may be human faults leading to the renaming of a tropical cyclone. This is especially true
if the system is poorly organized or if it passes from the area of responsibility of one forecaster to another. Examples
include Tropical Storm Ken-Lola in 1989 and Tropical Storm Upana-Chanchu in 2000</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>History of tropical cyclone naming</h4>
<p class="lead">For several hundred years after Europeans arrived in the West Indies, hurricanes there were named after the saint's day
on which the storm struck. If a second storm struck on the same saint's day later, it would be referred to as segundo
(Spanish for "the second"), as with Hurricane San Felipe Segundo.</p>
<p class="cont">The practice of giving storms people's names was introduced by Clement Lindley Wragge, an Anglo-Australian meteorologist
at the end of the 19th century. He used girls' names, the names of politicians who had offended him, and names from history
and mythology.</p>
<p class="cont">During World War II, tropical cyclones were given feminine names, mainly for the convenience of the forecasters
and in a somewhat ad hoc manner. In addition, George R. Stewart's 1941 novel <i>Storm</i> help to popularize the concept of giving
names to tropical cyclones.</p>
<p class="cont">From 1950 to 1954, names from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were used for storms in the North Atlantic.
The modern naming convention came about in response to the need for unambiguous radio communications with ships and aircraft.
As transportation traffic increased and meteorological observations improved in number and quality, several typhoons,
hurricanes or cyclones might have to be tracked at any given time. To help in their identification, beginning in 1953
the practice of systematically naming tropical storms and hurricanes was initiated by the United States National Hurricane Center.
Naming is now maintained by the World Meteorological Organization.</p>
<p class="cont">In keeping with the common English language practice of referring to named inanimate objects such as boats, trains,
etc., using the female pronoun "she," names used were exclusively feminine. The first storm of the year was assigned a name beginning
with the letter "A", the second with the letter "B", etc. However, since tropical storms and hurricanes are primarily destructive,
some considered this practice sexist. The World Meteorological Organization responded to these concerns in 1979 with the introduction
of masculine names to the nomenclature. It was also in 1979 that the practice of preparing a list of names before the season began.
The names are usually of English, French or Spanish origin in the Atlantic basin, since these are the three predominant languages
of the region which the storms typically affect. In the southern hemisphere, male names were given to cyclones starting in 1975.</p>
<h3>Notable cyclones</h3>
<p class="lead">Tropical cyclones that cause massive destruction are fortunately rare, but when they happen, they can cause damage in the
range of billions of dollars and disrupt or end thousands of lives.</p>
<p class="cont">The deadliest tropical cyclone on record hit the densely populated Ganges Delta region of Bangladesh on November 13, 1970,
likely as a Category 3 tropical cyclone. It killed an estimated 500,000 people. The North Indian basin has historically been the deadliest,
with several storms since 1900 killing over 100,000 people, each in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="cont">In the Atlantic basin, at least three storms have killed more than 10,000 people. Hurricane Mitch during the 1998 Atlantic
hurricane season caused severe flooding and mudslides in Honduras, killing about 18,000 people and changing the landscape enough that
entirely new maps of the country were needed. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900, which made landfall at Galveston, Texas as an estimated
Category 4 storm, killed 8,000 to 12,000 people, and remains the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the United States.
The deadliest Atlantic storm on record was the Great Hurricane of 1780, which killed about 22,000 people in the Antilles.</p>

<p class="icap">The relative sizes of Typhoon Tip, Tropical Cyclone Tracy, and the United States.</p>
</div>
<p class="cont">The most intense storm on record was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979, which had a minimum
pressure of only 870 mbar and maximum sustained wind speeds of 190 mph (305 km/h). It weakened before striking Japan.
Tip does not hold the record for fastest sustained winds in a cyclone alone; Typhoon Keith in the Pacific, and Hurricane Camille
and Hurricane Allen in the North Atlantic currently share this record as well, although recorded wind speeds that fast are suspect
since most monitoring equipment is likely to be destroyed by such extreme conditions. Camille was the only storm to actually strike
land while at that intensity, making it, with 190 mph (305 km/h) sustained winds and 210 mph (335 km/h) gusts, the strongest tropical
cyclone on record at landfall. For comparison, these speeds are encountered at the center of a strong tornado, but Camille, like all
tropical cyclones, was much larger and long-lived than any tornado.</p>
<p class="cont">Typhoon Nancy in 1961 had recorded wind speeds of 215 mph (345 km/h), but recent research indicates that wind speeds
from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high, and this is no longer considered the fastest storm on record. Similarly, a surface-level
gust caused by Typhoon Paka on Guam was recorded at 236 mph (380 km/h); had it been confirmed, this would be the strongest non-tornadic
wind ever recorded at the Earth's surface, but the reading had to be discarded since the anemometer was damaged by the storm.</p>
<p class="cont">Tip was also the largest cyclone on record, with a circulation of tropical storm-force winds 1,350 miles (2,170 km) wide.
The average tropical cyclone is only 300 miles (480 km) wide. The smallest storm on record, 1974's Cyclone Tracy, which devastated Darwin,
Australia, was roughly 60 miles (100 km) wide.</p>
<p class="cont">Hurricane Iniki in 1992 was the most powerful storm to strike Hawaii in recorded history, hitting Kauai
as a Category 4 hurricane, killing six and causing $3 billion in damage. Other destructive Pacific hurricanes include Pauline and Kenna.</p>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:731px">
<img class="ipic" src="731px-Brazil_hurricane.jpg" alt="Brazil hurricane"/>
<p class="icap">The first recorded South Atlantic cyclone, Cyclone Catarina from 2004.</p>
</div>
<p class="cont">On March 26, 2004, Cyclone Catarina became the first recorded South Atlantic cyclone (cyclone is the southern hemispheric
term for hurricane). Previous South Atlantic cyclones in 1991 and 2004 reached only tropical storm strength. Tropical cyclones may have
formed there before 1960 but were not observed until weather satellites began monitoring the Earth's oceans in that year.</p>
<p class="cont">A tropical cyclone need not be particularly strong to cause memorable damage; Tropical Storm Thelma, in November 1991
killed thousands in the Philippines even though it never became a typhoon; the damage from Thelma was mostly due to flooding,
not winds or storm surge. In 1982, the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul caused the deaths of
around 1,000 people in Central America due to the effects of its rainfall. In addition, Hurricane Jeanne in 2004 caused the majority
of its damage in Haiti, including approximately 3,000 deaths, while just a tropical depression.</p>
<p class="cont">On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi. The U.S. National Hurricane Center,
in its August review of the tropical storm season stated that Katrina was probably the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. Currently,
its death toll is at least 1,836, mainly from flooding and the aftermath in New Orleans, Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
It is also estimated to have caused $81.2 billion in property damage. Before Katrina, the costliest system in monetary terms had
been 1992's Hurricane Andrew, which caused an estimated $39 billion (2005 USD) in damage in Florida.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other storm systems</h2>
<p class="lead">Many other forms of cyclone can form in nature. Two of these relate to the formation or dissipation of tropical cyclones.</p>
<h3>Extratropical cyclone</h3>
<p class="lead">An <a href="../extratropical_cyclone/index.xhtml">extratropical cyclone</a> is a storm
that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences, which are typical in higher
latitudes. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released
by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses; Additionally, although not as frequently, an extratropical cyclone
can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone. From space, extratropical storms have a characteristic
"comma-shaped" cloud pattern. Extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous because their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds.</p>
<h3>Subtropical cyclone</h3>
<p class="lead">A <a href="../subtropical_cyclone/index.xhtml">subtropical cyclone</a> is a weather system that has some
characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics
of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitude, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely
attain hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their core warms. From an operational standpoint, a tropical
cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.</p>
