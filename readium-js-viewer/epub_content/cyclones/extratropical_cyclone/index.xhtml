<p class="lead">An <b>extratropical cyclone</b>, sometimes simply called a cyclone, is a large low
pressure weather system that (in the broader definition) is not a
<a href="../tropical_cyclone/index.xhtml">tropical cyclone</a> or polar cyclone.
They differ from tropical and polar cyclones by the fact that they are connected with fronts and
horizontal gradients in temperature and in dewpoint, which are otherwise known as "baroclinic zones".</p>
<p class="cont">The descriptor "extratropical" refers to the fact that this type of cyclone generally
occurs in the middle latitudes of the planet, outside of the tropics. These systems are also known as
"mid-latitude cyclones" due to their area of formation, or "post-tropical cyclones" (depending on
a given cyclone's origin). They can also be referred to in forecasts and by the general public
as "depressions" or "lows". The term refers to the everyday phenomenon which, along with anti-cyclones,
drive the weather in much of the northern and southern hemispheres of the planet.</p>
<p class="cont">Although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they
form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient, they can sometimes become barotropic late in
their life cycle, when the temperature distibution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius.
See the article baroclinic and barotropic cyclones for more information on this matter.</p>
<h2>Formation</h2>
<p class="lead">Extratropical cyclones form anywhere within the extratropical regions of the Earth,
usually between thirty and sixty degrees latitude from the equator. They generally form in one of two
ways, being through either cyclogenesis or extratropical transition.</p>
<h3>Cyclogenesis</h3>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:287px">
<img class="ipic" src="Jetstreak.gif" alt="jet streak"/>
<p class="icap">An upper level jet streak. DIV areas are regions of divergence aloft, which will lead
to surface convergence and aid cyclogenesis.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Since extratropical cyclones form along linear bands of temperature/dewpoint gradient
with significant vertical wind shear, they are classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis,
or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of the upper level jet.
The right rear and left front quadrants of jet are most favorable for upper level divergence. Due to the
upper divergence, air rushes out from the top of that column of air, which forces convergence in the low
level wind field and increased upward motion in the column. Increased upward motion causes surface pressures
to lower as the upward air motion counteracts gravity, lessening the weight of the atmosphere (surface pressure)
in that location. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and around
its western periphery due to the greater density of the cold air in its wake, while its warm front
progresses much more slowly as a result of it being more difficult to dislodge (or erode) the cooler
air ahead of the system due to it's greater density. When cyclones begin this march into the colder
air aloft, they occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes the western section of the warm
front, forcing a tongue of warm air aloft, or trowal. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold
and begin to weaken.</p>
<p class="cont">The air pressure in these cyclones can fall rapidly, or bomb, to below 980 millibars
(980 hectopascals) (hPa) (SI) under favorable conditions, such as near a natural temperature gradient like
the Gulf Stream or at a preferred quadrant of an upper level jet streak where upper level divergence is best.
The stronger the upper level divergence over the cyclone, the deeper the cyclone can become. The lowest
pressure measured from an extratropical cyclone in the United States was 951.7 hPa on March 1, 1914 in Bridgehampton,
New York. Between January 4 and January 5, 1989, an extratropical cyclone south of Atlantic Canada
deepened to 928 hPa.</p>
<h3>Extratropical transition</h3>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:600px">
<img class="ipic" src="600px-ETS_Florence_2006.jpg" alt="Cyclone Florence"/>
<p class="icap">Cyclone Florence in the north Atlantic after completing its transition to an extratropical

</div>
<p class="lead">Tropical cyclones often transit into extratropical cyclones at the end of their tropical
existence, usually between 30° and 40° latitude when there is sufficient upper level forcing from an upper-level
trough or a short wave riding the Westerlies. This process is known as extratropical transition. During extratropical
transition, the cyclone begins to tilt back into the colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary
energy source converts from the release of latent heat of condensation (from thunderstorms near the center)
to baroclinic processes. The low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold cored system.
During this process, a cylone in extratropical transition (in Canada known as the post-tropical stage)
will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and/or troughs consistant with a baroclinic system,
and the breadth/size of the overall depression will usually be seen to increase, while the core of the
depression will usually weaken at first before re-stengthening to a depth that will depend on the environmental
conditions it arrives in. The cyclone will also distort in shape, becoming less symmetric with time.</p>
<p class="cont">On rare occasions, an extratropical cyclone can transition into a tropical cyclone if it
enters warmer waters and an environment with less vertical wind shear. The height of subtropical cyclogenesis,
which is the midpoint of this transition, occurs in the months of September and October when the differences
between the temperature of the air aloft and the sea surface temperatures are the greatest, leading to the
most potential for instability.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<h3>Surface pressure/Wind distribution</h3>

<p class="icap">Quikscat image of typical extratropical cyclones over the ocean. Note the maximum winds are

</div>
<p class="lead">The center of a cyclone is defined as its area of lowest pressure. Near the center of the cyclone
the pressure gradient force (from the pressure in the center of the cyclone compared the pressure outside the cyclone)
and the Coriolis force must be in an approximate balance (or else the cyclone would collapse in on itself under
the pressure gradient). In the beginning, the sea-level pressure is not very low; typically below 1013.2 mbar (hPa),
which is the average sea level pressure for Earth. Nearly always called by the term low-pressure cells in North America,
they often form quickly along stationary of cold fronts when the required upper level forcing exists such as an
upper level jet streak or an upper level shortwave. Usually, the part of the front ahead of the cyclone will
develop into a warm front, giving the frontal zone (as drawn on surface weather analyses a wave-like shape.
Hence, early in their life cycles, extratropical cyclones can also be referred to as frontal waves. An old
name for such a system is "warm wave" (in the United States). Intensification or "deepening" of the cyclone
progresses slowly if forcing aloft is weak. In the Arctic, the average pressure for cyclones is 988 hPa during
the winter, and 1000 hPa during the summer. Rapidly falling atmospheric pressure is possible due to strong upper
level forcing, and such a cyclone is sometimes referred to as a bomb.</p>
<p class="cont">The highest winds in extratropical cyclones are typically just on the cold/poleward side of warm
fronts and occlusions, as well as just behind cold fronts. This is because these areas tend to have the greatest
pressure gradient, which is the cause of wind.</p>
<h3>Rotation</h3>
<p class="lead">The wind flow around a large cyclone, generally referred due as cyclonic, is counterclockwise in
the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, due to the Coriolis effect.</p>
<h3>Vertical structure</h3>
<p class="lead">Mid-Latitude cyclones slant back into colder air masses with height, and can exceed 30,000 feet
(c. 10km) in depth. Above the surface of the earth, the air temperature near the center of the storm is increasingly
colder than the surrounding environment. Extratropical cyclones strengthen with height, completely opposite to
their tropical counterparts. Mid-latitude cyclones are called "cold-core lows" for these reasons. Various charts
can be examined to check its characteristics with height, such as the 700 millibars (hectopascals) (hPa) (SI) chart,
which is at about 10,000 feet or 3,000 meters in height. Cyclone phase space diagrams can tell you whether
a cyclone is tropical, subtropical, or extratropical.</p>
<h2>Cyclone evolution</h2>

<p class="icap">Norwegian cyclone and Shapiro-Keyser model differences in frontal structure.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">There are two main models (which can be roughly described as "descriptions" in a non-specialist sense)
of cyclone development and lifecycles in common use - The Norwegian model and the Shapiro-Keyser Model.</p>
<h3>Norwegian cyclone model</h3>
<p class="lead">Of the two theories on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the oldest is the Norwegian
Cyclone Model, developed during World War I. In this theory, cyclones develop as they move up and along a frontal
boundary, eventually occluding and ending up in a barotropically cold envirnoment. It was developed completely
from surface-based weather observations, including descriptions of cloud character near frontal boundaries.
This theory still retains much merit over continental landmasses.</p>
<h3>Shapiro-Keyser model</h3>

<img class="ipic" src="Medionalflowpattern.jpg" alt="Meridional Flow pattern"/>
<p class="icap">Meridional Flow pattern of October 23, 2003. Note the amplified troughs and ridges in this 500
hPa height pattern.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">A second competing theory for extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser
model, developed in 1990. Its main difference with the Norwegian Cyclone Model is the fracture of the cold front,
treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm
sector at a right angle to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure,
as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used planes to determine the vertical structure of
fronts across the northwest Atlantic.</p>
<h4>Warm seclusion</h4>
<p class="lead">A <b>warm seclusion</b> is the mature phase of the extratropical cyclone lifecycle conceptualized by Shapiro
and Keyser after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s. Observations of intense marine cyclones indicated an
anomalously warm low-level thermal structure secluded (surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident
chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model as developed by the Bergen school of
meteorology largely observed cyclones at the tail end of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify
the decaying stages.</p>
<p class="cont">Warm selcusions may have cloud-free eye-like features at their center reminiscent of tropical cyclones,
significant pressure falls, hurricane force winds, and moderate to strong convection. The most intense warm seclusion
generally attain pressures less than 950 mb with definitive lower to midlevel warm core structure. A warm seclusion
is the result of a baroclinic lifecycle and occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics. The process known as
Tropical Transition involves the usually slow development of an extratropically cold core vortex into a tropical cyclone.</p>
<p class="cont">As latent heat flux releases are important for development and intesification, a vast majority
of warm seclusion events occur over the world's oceans and may impact coastal nations with hurricane force winds
and torrential rain. Climatologically, the Northern Hemisphere sees warm seclusions during the cold season months.
The Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, may see a strong cyclone event such as this during all times of the year.</p>
<p class="cont">In all tropical basins, except the Northern Indian Ocean, the extratropical transition of a tropical
cyclone may result in reintensification into a warm seclusion. For example, Hurricanes Irene and Maria of 2005
reintensified into strong baroclinic systems and achieved warm seclusion status at maturity (or lowest pressure).</p>
<h2>Motion</h2>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:413px">
<img class="ipic" src="Zonalflow.gif" alt="zonal flow regime"/>
<p class="icap">A zonal flow regime. Note the dominant west-to-east flow as shown in the 500 hPa height pattern.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Extratropical cyclones are generally driven, or "steered", by deep westerly winds in a general
west to east motion across both hemispheres when the flow in zonal. A zonal flow regime is the meteorological term
meaning that the general flow pattern is west to east along the earth's latitude lines, with weak shortwaves embedded
in the flow. When the general flow pattern buckles from a zonal pattern to the medional pattern, a slower movement in
a poleward or equatorward direction is more likely. Meridional flow patterns feature strong, amplified troughs and ridges,
with more north-south flow in the general pattern than west-to-east flow.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<div class="ibox_r" style="max-width:800px">
<img class="ipic" src="800px-Snowcsi.gif" alt="Preferred region of snowfall"/>
<p class="icap">Preferred region of snowfall in an extratropical cyclone.</p>
</div>
<p class="lead">Extratropical cyclones can bring mild weather with a little rain and surface winds of 7-15 knots,
or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding 64 knots, (sometimes referred to as windstorms
in Europe.) The band of precipitation that is associated with the warm front is often extensive. Cyclones tend to move
along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During late fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over
continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.</p>
<p class="cont">While most tropical cyclones that become extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another
weather system, they can still retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical
over North Carolina while a strong Category 3 storm. The Columbus Day Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains
of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage well north in Oregon and Washington states with widespread damage equivalent
to a Category 3 or higher hurricane. More recently, Hurricane Wilma in 2005 began to lose tropical characteristics
while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical while still a Category 1 storm).</p>
